# pamguard.github.io

PAMGuard web page. 

Source for building the webpage is all in a separate repository [https://github.com/PAMGuard/website](https://github.com/PAMGuard/website)
and only the final build is being transferred here to make it easier to separate development from release since the final release 
contains some very large folders with the API and Online help docs. By separating the source and the release it's become easier to 
manage these.
