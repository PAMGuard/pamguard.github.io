    "text": "The video range modules in PAMGuard are used to analyse grabbed video images in order to measure the range to an object floating on the water.\nThe principle of the method is very simple. The range to floating objects at sea can be calculated from the angle of dip between the horizon and the waterline of the object. Often this angle is estimated using reticules in binoculars, but this is difficult and inaccurate, especially when the subjects are small marine mammals that are only fleetingly visible at the surface. However, the angle can be measured accurately and at leisure from an image taken with a calibrated lens from a known height.\nimages can be obtained using either still or video cameras. With the advent of affordable higher definition video equipment HD camcorders are usually the most effective means of obtaining the necessary images. Some practical information on equipment and field procedures can be found at http://www.ecologicuk.co.uk/\nThe method can also be applied from land stations (an application for which theodolites are traditionally employed.) When used from land station its necessary to configure PAMGuard with a fixed stationary array. Instruction on setting up PAMGuard in this mode are found here.\nThe methods implemented here are described in detail in Leaper, R., and Gordon, J. 2001. Application of photogrammetric methods for locating and tracking cetacean movements at sea. J. CETACEAN RES. MANAGE. 3(2):131-141\nThe first step is to create an instance of a video range module in PAMGuard\nNext: Adding and Setting up a New Video Range Module",

This can be quick and efficient if you know what you are doing and is useful if you have several similar controls since you can copy and modify entire rows in the UDF table.\nA much more simple method is to use to the built in form editing functions which can be accessed directly from the logger forms menus: Settings/Logger Forms/Edit Forms/[]Your form name].\nThe built in form editor is modifying the same underlying information in the UDF tables in the database so it is normally possible to use a combination of direct editing of the UDF tables and the in built form editor.\n\nEditing the UDF Table\nTo add controls to the form, you simply type lines of instructions into the UDF_ table. PAMGuard will interpret these and generate the appropriate input fields on the display and output columns in the output database table.\nAlthough there are many different columns in the UDF_ tables, generally only a few of them need to be filled in for basic functionality with most control types.\nNow go back to the UDF_ table in the database and start to add controls. Whenever you want to see these changes on the display simply execute the menu command “Detection/Logger forms/Regenerate all forms”\n\n\nUsing the Inbuilt Forms Editor\nTo access the forms editor, from the PAMGuard menu select Settings/Logger Forms/Edit Forms/[]Your form name] to show the forms editing dialog:\n\nUse the buttons to the left of the dialog to add, delete and change the order of controls. When a control is selected in the controls list, it’s properties will appear in th erigh thad side of the dialog. Enter appropriate values as required for each control type.\nAt any point you can preview the form. Pressing OK will cause the dialog to close and the form to be updated on the PAMGuard user interface.\nSelect the “Form Properties” tab to change form properties such as colour, alerts, etc.\nSee below for further informaton on Control and Property types.\n\n\nControl Types\nThere are two types of control which can be added to the form: Data controls and Property controls.\nActive controls are something that handles data, i.e. will have something to type into on the display and will have an column for output data in the output database table.\nProperty controls don’t control data in any way, but affect the appearance or general behaviour of the form.\n\n\nNMEA Input\nAll controls can now receive NMEA input, no just NMEACHAR, NMEAFLOAT and NMEAINT.\nTo set up NMEA input on a control, fill in the three fields of the UDF_ table NMEA_Module, NMEA_String and NMEA_Position.\nNMEA_Moduleshoud be the name of the NMEA module you expect to find data in, e.g. “NMEA Data Collection”. If you leave this empty it will search for data in the first NMEA module it finds.\nNMEA_String is the name of the NMEA string containing the data, e.g. “GPRMC”.\nNMEA_Position is the index of the data item within the NMEA string (0 is the string name, 1 the first data item, etc).\nFurther details are provided in individual Data Control descriptions below:\n\nData Control Types\n\nCHAR for character data\nCHECKBOX for logical data\nCOUNTER for auto incrementing counters\nDOUBLE for double precision data\nINTEGER for integer data\nLOOKUP for drop down lists\nLATLONG to Lat Long information\nNMEACHAR for NMEA character data\nNMEAFLOAT for NMEA floating point data\nNMEAINT for NMEA integer data\nSHORT for short integer (16 bit) data\nSINGLE for single precision floating point data\nTIME for time data\nTIMESTAMP for date and time data\nNEWLINE forces the next control to appear at the start of the next line\n\n\n\nProperty Control Types\n\nAUTOALERT Issues a warning when the form is due to be filled in\nAUTORECORD Not yet implemented\nBEARING Selects a Data Control which contains bearing information which will be used on the map display\nRANGE Selects a Data Control which contains range information which will be used on the map display\nHEADING Selects a Data Control which contains heading information which will be used on the map display\nPLOT Indicates that the data from these forms can be plotted on the PAMGuard map (note that there are also options with many Data Controls which give finer control over plot options)\nNOCLEAR The clear button will be removed from a form\nNOCANCEL The clear button will be removed from a form\nREADONTIMER The form will be read automatically and saved on a timer\nREADONGPS The form will be read automatically and saved whenever new GPS data arrive (not yet implemented)\nREADONMEA The form will be read automatically and saved whenever new NMEA data arrive\nSUBTABS Forms will be displayed on sub-tabs (allowing multiple forms of the same type to be open simultaneously)\nSYMBOLTYPE The type of symbol used for plotting on the map",

    "text": "The Tethys display is great for outputting data from one set of data, giving you fine scale control over what is output, and instant access to the documents created in the database. However, what if you want to output Tethys data from several different PAMGuard datasets ? You could open each dataset with PAMGuard Viewer, add the Tethys module, then output the Calibrations, Deployments, and Detections. Or you could use the PAMGuard batch processor (version 2.0 or later) to automate the entire process and do the whole lot. This is particularly useful if the outputs take a long time, since the batch processor will run multiple ‘jobs’ sequentially, e.g. over night.\nThe batch processor is currently a PAMGuard plugin module which is installed separately from the main program. In future releases, it may be incorporated as a core module.\nOne installed, help pages for the batch processor will be available within the online help. Read the instructions on setting up batch processing for PAMGuard viewer tasks, then configure jobs (sets of PAMGuard data to process) you want to export to Tethys.\n\nIn your batch configuration psfx file (yes, you use a psfx file, for controlling Viewer tasks in the batch processor) add the Tethys module if not already present. A list of possible Tethys output tasks will then be added to the the Offline Tasks table. It is quite possible that the check boxes used to select the Tethys tasks will be disabled at this point. Hover the mouse over each task and it will tell you why, so that you can rectify the problem and proceed.The three main reasons why a Tethys task cannot operate are\n\nThe Tethys server is not running.\nInstrument and array information has not been entered correctly\nRequired information for the task (such as Deployment abstract information) has not been entered.\nITIS Species codes have not been entered for Detections and Localisations output.\n\nIt is important that you set up the array for each job with correct Instrument / array information. This can be set for each task by right clicking on the appropriate line in the jobs table.\nOnce all the required information has been entered, you can select the tasks you want to run and start outputting to Tethys. There are a fair number of things that can go wrong at this stage, so it’s important that you check the output either in the Tethys Client, or by opening the PAMGuard datasets in viewer mode to check their Tethys output.\nNote that this is very new functionality.

    "text": "There are two different workflows, depending on whether a Quick Test or a Random Drill is being run. Descriptions of each test can be found in the Overview.\n\nQuick Test\nThe goal of a Quick Test is to determine the detection functionality of the PAM system in the current environmental conditions. The test is not intended to evaluate operator performance, but primarily to evaluate the efficacy of the automated detectors. Therefore, once started, the operator simply needs to wait until the Quick Test is complete. No further interaction is required.\nDetection matching takes place in real time, with the SIDE module monitoring data coming from each detector and matching the simulated sounds with the detections. A match between an injected signal and detection is counted if there is overlap in time and frequency of the simulated sounds and the detection.\nA summary report can be immediately generated for operator review once the Quick Test has completed.\n\n\nRandom Drill\nRandom Drills are intended to test both operator alertness and automated detector efficiency over much longer periods of time and different noise conditions. Sequences are injected into the audio stream like the Quick Test, but at an infrequent rate (every few hours) over a period of days or even weeks.\nThe operator has three different methods to indicate that they have detected a sound.\n\nThey can draw an annotation box around the signal in the spectrgoram\nThey can hit the Print Screen button in the top-left corner of the PAMGuard window\nThey can click a Things Heard button if they have an Aural Listening Form module loaded\n\nIn the case of an annotation box, a match between an injected signal and an operator detection is counted if there is an overlap in time and frequency of the simulated sound and the annotation box. For the Print Screen and Things Heard buttons, it is likely that the operator will have pressed the button at some time after the sound first becomes visible on the display. For these annotation types therefore, a match is considered good if the button was pressed within 30s of the sound reaching the hydrophones.\nAutomated detectors are evaluated the same as in the Quick Tests.\nOver an extended period of time Random Drills will generate the same statistics as the quick tests, but are more likely to capture the full range of operational (noise) conditions and operator attentiveness.\nPrevious: Sidebar\nNext: SIDE Output",

The operator can choose whether to show results for both sounds and sequences, or sequences only. Detection efficiency of separate detectors can be displayed on a single plot (if there are not too many detectors) or on separate plots (for multiple detectors).\nA logistic regression will be conducted for each Species Cluster / detector (or human) combination and a report automatically generated as a Microsoft Word document.

Hydrophones within each streamer (or cluster) are assumed to be connected rigidly to one another and have a common origin. Within this context a moored or drifting buoy should be considered as a streamer. The streamer origin will generally be referenced to the vessels GPS position, or a fixed Latitude and Longitude.\nEach streamer has a Hydrophone Locator system. This tells PAMGuard how to calculate the actual positions of the individual hydrophones from the streamer origin. Moored hydrophones generally use a rigid locator, whereas towed hydrophones are usually better off using a threading hydrophone locator which will give more accurate hydrophone positions as the vessel turns a corner.\nA single array can mix streamers of different types.\nSeveral different arrays may be managed and stored, although only one is loaded at any one time.\nEach array may contain up to 32 individual hydrophone elements (transducers).\nA one-to-many relationship exists between hydrophones and software channels.\nEach hydrophone element must be assigned to a streamer. The actual coordinates for each hydrophone used by PAMGuard are the sum of the streamer coordinates and the individual hydrophone element coordinates. Although this appears to introduce some redundancy regarding the coordinates of each hydrophone, streamer assignment is important for two reasons. Firstly, it allows the errors on the relative locations of pairs of hydrophones to be more accurately defined (the errors between hydrophones in different streamers will generally be greater than the errors on a hydrophone in the same streamer). Secondly, should a streamer be moved or shortened, it is easier to adjust the coordinates of a single streamer than to adjust the coordinates of all hydrophones individually.\n\nThe Default Array\nThe first time you run PAMGuard, a default array consisting of two hydrophone elements spaced 3m apart at 5m depth, 100m and 103m astern of the vessel. Channels in the array are mapped 1:1 to ADC channels 0 and 1.\nNext: Array Configuration",

    "text": "In Viewer Mode, database tables can be imported or exported from the current PAMGuard database to and from external databases. This feature can be used to copy an entire database (for example, you may need to import and old Microsoft Access database into the newer SQLite database format) or you could copy data for an subset of tables (for example, import the UDF_ logger forms definitions from another database).\nCurrently, in order to avoid duplicating data, it is only possible to copy entire database tables into entirely empty database tables. If you wish to transfer data into a table which already contains data, you will be prompted to delete and recreate that table prior to importing / exporting data.\nTo export or import data, select one of the File&gt;Database&gt;External&gt;Export to database or Import from database menu items.\nYou will then be presented with the database selection dialog where you chose the database you want to exchange data with.\nOnce you select a database, you will see the Import / Export dialog where you can chose which tables to copy between the two databases. (There may be a short delay while PAMGuard analyses the external database).\n\n\n\nSQLite Configuration\n\n\nIf you are transferring data to a new blank database, then it’s likely that most of the destination tables will show an Error. Hover the mouse over the buttons to see the error. Most likely it’s simply that the tables need creating. Press the “Create” button near the top of the screen and the errors will disappear. If tables already contain data, they will be flagged as “Warning”. Again, hover the mouse over each button to see what’s wrong. Click the button for a menu of possible actions to fix any problems (generally dropping and recreating tables).\nSelect the tables you wish to export / import and press “Start”.\nIf you are importing data, at the end of the import process, by default, PAMGuard will load the latest configuration from the imported configuration tables. Un-check the box if you do not want this to happen.\n\nIndexing and Cross Referencing\nEvery PAMGuard database table has an indexed column named “Id”. This number is automatically generated as data are written to the table and may therefore change when data are copied between databases.\nFor simple data, where the original data were written by PAMGuard and nothing was deleted, then it’s likely that the Id’s will be the same. However, for data which have been manipulated either by someone messing with the database or by data being added / deleted in the Viewer, then it’s likely that the copied data will have different Id’s\nTo keep track of data, each copied database table will contain an additional column with the name “CopyId”. This will contain the Id of the data in the table it was copied from.\nFor most data this is not a problem. However, Click Detector events marked in the PAMGuard Viewer populate two database tables one of which cross references to the other. With the possible change of Id’s, these cross references may no longer be correct. PAMGuard will automatically correct these altered cross references.\nOtherwise, you will only ever be aware of these Id changes should you have referred to an event by it’s Id - e.g. if you emailed a colleague and event number to check over.\nBack to database main page",

    "text": "The Viewer funtion is new so you probably did not include binary storage module when you collected your data. Also what about older data sets you would like to analyse now with viewer. This brief description shows you the necessary steps to process your data so you can create binary files offline so you can use PAMGuard Viewer.\nFirst you have collected Rainbow Click Files. These can be imported and converted directly.\nSecondly, you have collected continous recordings (.wav files) but no binaries. You need to process your .wav files offline to create binaries. Open up PAMGuard (online) and add the following modules:Sound Acquisition, Click detector, Database and Binary Stoarage. If you are not interested in clicks but whistles the same principle applies. You just have to add the whistle & moan detector. Noise measurments can also be processed this way.\n\nSound Acquisition\nGo to Detection&gt;Sound Aquistion. Choose either ‘Audio file’ or ‘Audio file folder or multiple files’ in the Data Dource Type dropdown list. Choose the appropiate folder where your file/files are stored. Make sure the box ‘include subfolders is ticked’ so all files get processed. Check that the box_‘Repeat: Ant end of file list, start again’_ is NOT ticked. Press ok.\n\n\n\nAudioDataAcquisition\n\n\n\n\nDatabase selection\nBefore you select your database, you have to create a blank database you can use. If you collected GPS data during the data collection you can import that table in your blank database. Make sure it is called gpsData and is in the right GPS format. You can also add your GPS table after you processed the data.\nGo to File&gt;database selection and select the appropiate data base.\n\n\nBinary Storage\nYou have to select a folder where the binaries are going to be stored. Go to Go to File&gt;Binary Storage options for your selection.\n\n\nClick Detector\nSet up the Click detector for your purposes. You can change some paramters again in Viewer mode with the option Reanalyse click types but as it it time intensive you should set it up correctly.\nAfter you set up everything you might as well save the .psfx file so you have a template for the future. The data model should look like this. You can also add some notch filters beforehand if the data is really noisy.\n\n\n\nData_model\n\n\nThe next step is to start processing the data. Go to Detection&gt;Start. Now the .wav files are processed and binary files are created. This can be quite time consuming depending on how much data you process and how fast your computer is. It could take a couple of hours to a couple of days. PAMGuard will tell you approximatley when it is finishing, which file it is processing and how fast real time it is processing (RT). After it is finished you can open up PAMGuard Viewer.\n\n\n\nRunning",

The latter is slightly safer since the copied database can become corrupted if the database it updated while it is copying.\n\nOther types of data\nIf you also want to back up other types of data being collected on the same computer, but not by PAMGuard, then you can use the menu Settings&gt;Backup Manager&gt;Add Stream and then configure the new data stream on the main backup manager display to take files from within a designated folder and Copy / Move / Delete them as for the binary files and recordings above.

Ideally, you should select the same device for output as you are using for input to guarantee that they are running at exactly the same speed. Sometimes this is either impossible (because the input device doesn’t have any outputs) or impractical for other reasons in which case you can use a different device but should be aware that there may be ‘glitches’ in the output.\nIf you’re using the same device for output as for input, always use the same output sample rate. If using a different device, then you may need to use a different output sample rate, for example if your input data come from a high speed acquisition card sampling at 500kHz and you wish to play back through a sound card which can only output at 48kHz. In this case, PAMGuard will automatically decimate or up-sample the data so that the play-back is in real time. Of course, if you’re acquiring high frequency data, you’ll only be able to hear the part of that data that’s in the audio band.\n\n\nFile or PAMGuard Viewer play-back\nIf processing data from file, or using PAMGuard viewer, the speed at which data can play can be varied by the user via controls in the dialog or side panel.\nData will automatically be decimated or up-sampled to match the input sample rate, output sample rate of the device and the selected play speed.\n\n\nCreating sound output modules\nFrom the File&gt;Add modules&gt;Sound Processing menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select “Sound Output”.

This will bring up the Sound Output dialog.\n\nData Source\nThe sound output module requires a source of raw data before it can operate. Select a raw data source from the drop down list.\nSelect the data channels. Note that a sound card will only be able to play back two channels at a time and you will therefore only be able to check one or two boxes.\n\n\nOptions\nThe available options will depend on the type of sound acquisition device.\n\nSound Card and ASIO Sound Card Input\nIf using a sound card input, you will only be able to play back out through a sound card, and should ideally select the same device.\nYou will be restricted to two output channels. Once two channels are selected, other channels will be ‘grayed out’. De-select a channel in order to make a fresh selection.\n\n\n\nSound Output Dialog\n\n\n\n\nOther Input Devices\nIf using other input devices, (National Instruments cards, SAIL Daq cards, etc.) you can play back through any available device, though it is recommended that you use the same device if at all possible.\nThe sample rate of the output device does not need to match the input sample rate and PAMGuard will automatically up-sample or decimate data to convert between the input sample rate and the output sample rate.\n\n\n\nSound Output Dialog\n\n\n\n\nAudio files and File Folders\nSelect the output device type which can either be a sound card or a National Instruments device.\nSet the output sample rate. This can be anything so long as it is supported by the output device you are using.\nSet the play-back speed. This is how many times real-time the data will play at.\nPAMGuard will automatically up-sample or decimate data to convert between the input sample rate and the output sample rate, taking into account the playback speed.\nIf listening on headphones via a sound card, then an output sample rate of 48kHz or 96kHz is recommended. however, if you’re outputting data from PAMGuard for other purposes, such as driving a high frequency sound source, then you will need to select an appropriately high sample rate and ensure that you are using an output device that supports that sample rate.\nNote: During file analysis, if no channels are selected and there is no play-back, analysis will continue at the maximum rate possible using all available processor power. If sound play-back is enabled, then analysis will proceed at the speed governed by the sound play-back rate. If the processor can’t keep up with analysing data at the play-back rate, then play-back will appear interrupted and ‘glitchy’\nIt is possible to re-configure channels during analysis, so if you are analysing a lot of data, you may want to occasionally turn on sound output on one or two channels to have a listen, then turn them off again so that it processes as fast as possible.\nPrevious: Sound Output Overview\nNext: Sound Output Control",

    "text": "This module allows you to measure noise in frequency bands of different widths: Octave, Third Octave, Deci-Decade, Decade, 1/10 Octave, and 1/12 Octave. These measurements are compatible with the ANSI Standard ANSI S1.11-2004 American National Standard Specification for Octave-Band and Fractional-Octave-Band Analog and Digital Filters.\nThe method works by first measuring noise noise bands the highest octave of the available data using a bank of band pass filters. The data are then decimated by a factor 2 (or 10 for Decade bands) and a further set of measurements made in the next octave down (i.e. the highest octave of the decimated data). This process can be repeated for as many decimators / octaves of data that you wish, reaching lower and lower frequencies. Because the amount of raw data to be processed is halved in each decimator, each bank of filters requires increasingly less processing power.\n\nCreating the module\nFrom the File&gt;Add modules&gt;Sound Processing menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select ” Noise Band Monitor”. Enter a name for the new module and press Ok.\n\n\nConfiguring the module\nTo configure the module, open the settings dialog from the Detection&gt;“your module name” menu:\n\n\n\nFilters Settings\n\n\n\nRaw Data Source\nSelect a source of raw data. This will generally be a Sound Acquisition Module or the output of a Decimator if a lower frequency noise measurement is required. Check the channels you want to measure noise on.\n\n\nOutput Interval\nEnter the interval between measurements in seconds.\n\n\nMeasurement Bands\nSelect the band type you wish to measure in from the drop down list, and the Reference Frequency, which is the centre frequency of a band, against which all other band centres will be calculated. By default, this is 1000Hz.\nSelect the maximum and minimum frequencies you want to measure between. Bands will then be calculated to fit between these limits, i.e. the upper edge of the highest band will not be greater than the maximum frequency and the lower edge of the lowest band will not be lower than the minimum frequency. e.g. if you are working with third octave bands and set the frequency limits to be 200Hz and 24kHz, you’ll get 20 bands between 222.7Hz and 22.63kHz.\n\n\nFilters\nSelect Butterworth or IIR Filters. Generally, Butterworth filters will operate much faster than FIR filters on a desktop computer. Generally 6th order Butterworth or 7th order (128 tap) FIR filters are more than adequate. The exact cut off frequencies and filter responses are shown for information only.\n\n\nBode Plots\nThe filter responses and the responses of the decimators are shown in the Bode plot on the right hand side of the dialog. It is also possible to overlay the various ANSI standards. The scale of the amplitude axis can be altered by double clicking on it.\nPrevious: FFT Method\nNext: Displays and Output",

    "text": "PAMGuard contains two modules which can measure noise levels in multiple frequency bands. These are called the Noise Monitor and the Noise Band Monitor, both available from the File / Add Modules / Sound Processing menu.\nBoth modules should give the same results to within a fraction of a Decibel, so which you use is largely up to you. however, there are some subtle differences.\nThe Noise Monitor module works using FFT data as input. The resolution of the noise measurements in both time and frequency is therefore governed by how you’ve set up the FFF. For example, if you’ve data with a sample rate of 48kHz and are using a FFT length of 1024 samples, then the frequency resolution of the FFT will be 48000/1024 = 46.9Hz. Since the measurements are made by adding up multiple bins of data from the FFT’s, you can’t get a sensible measurement below a frequency bin size of about 200Hz. Further, the FFT time intervals may not align nicely with exact seconds, so the intervals between measurements may be a bit longer than you’ve asked for.\nThe Noise Band Monitor works differently, using a bank of filters to process the incoming raw data and these filters can go as low in frequency as you like, and take measurements from the data at the exat times you’ve asked for. On the other hand, the filter banks are slow to process, so this module will take more resources on your computer than the FFT based method.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are laid out below\n\n\n\nMethod\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\n\n\n\n\nNoise Monitor (FFT method)\nFaster (especially if you’re doing the FFT anyway); User can create non-standard bands\nPoor resolution at low frequency; Time intervals between measurement may not be precise\n\n\nNoise Band Monitor (Filter bank method)\nBetter resolution at low frequency; Accurate time intervals;\nSlower\n\n\n\nNext: FFT Method",

From the pop-up menu on the FFT Engine window in the PAMGuard Data Model display.\n\nSelect a data source\nFrom the drop down list select a source of audio data. When you select a new data source, the channel list will be updated to show the number of channels in the selected data source. Tick the check boxes for the channels you wish FFT data to be computed for.\nTo save processor power, do not calculate FFT data for channels that are not needed in subsequent PAMGuard processes.\n\n\nSet the FFT Length and Hop\nThe FFT algorithm is most efficient when the FFT length in samples is an exact power of 2, e.g. 256, 512, 1024, 2048, etc. However modern FFT algorithms can handle other FFT lengths if you really want them. For instance, if you have data sampled at 1000Hz and really want your FFT’s to be exactly 1/4 second long, you could chose a FFT length of 250 samples instead of 256. Non power of 2 FFT lengths will be fine with low frequency data, but if you’re processing high frequency data, we’d recommend that you maximise efficiency by sticking to powers of 2!\nThe little arrows to the right of the FFT Length field can be used to increment / decrement the length by powers of 2. For other values, simply type in what you want.\nThe FFT Hop is the number of samples between the start of successive FFT blocks - often this is set to half the FFT length to provide overlap. Some people like more overlap, since it can give a smoother display, however this is generally only introducing redundancy into the data and is not efficient.\nGenerally, you wouldn’t set the FFT Hop to be greater than the FFT Length, since that would mean that some data are never used. However, for simple diagnostics, such as an LTSA, it can be useful to have a bigger hop size since the FFT Engine would use less CPU and the LTSA would still be a good diagnostic tool to show background noise levels and demonstrate that channels are working.\nWhen configuring the FFT engine, it is important to think about the time and frequency resolution of the data you’re generating. The frequency resolution of the data is the sample rate divided by the FFT length, and the time resolution is the exact opposite, namely the FFT length divided by the sample rate. So if you pick a big FFT length, you’ll get really find frequency resolution, but poor time resolution and if you pick a small FFT length, you’ll get poor frequency resolution, but excellent time resolution. Think about the types of sounds you’ll be detecting, or viewing on displays using the FFT data. Generally, it’s helpful if the sounds are spread in both time AND frequency. For example, in the figures below the same right whale upsweep sounds are shown with three different FFT lengths.\n\nIn the top image, the FFT length is too short, so the calls are well spread out in time, but there is little frequency information. In the bottom display, the FFT length is too long, so there is excellent frequency resolution, but in time the calls are compressed into a single pixel of the display. The central panel has got it about right, the 256 point FFT giving a frequency resolution of 7.8 Hz, and a time resolution of 128ms - perfect for a call that lasts nearly a second and sweeps from 100 to 200Hz.\n\n\nSet the Window type\nSelect a windowing function from the following options:\nRectangular\nHamming\nHann (default)\nBartlett (Triangular)\nBlackman\nBlackman-Harris\nThe Hann window will be fine for most purposes.

    "text": "Decimators can be used to drop the frequency of raw audio data.\nFor example, you may have a raw audio data stream sampled at 96kHz (you might have sampled at this search for odontocete clicks); you also want to search for baleen whale sounds at around 100Hz. It would be inefficient to run the baleen whale detector on the 96kHz data. However, by using the Decimator to produce a new raw data stream at a few 100Hz and running the baleen whale detector on this, the total amount of processing will be reduced, spectrogram displays will also be more clearer.\nA decimator can be inserted anywhere in the PAMGuard data model where there are raw audio data.\n\nCreating a Decimator\nFrom the File&gt;Add modules&gt;Sound Processing menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select “Decimator”. Enter a name for the new decimator module (e.g. “2kHz”, etc) and press Ok.\n\n\nConfigure the Decimator\nThe Decimator module requires a source of raw data before it can operate. This may come directly from a Sound Acquisition module (e.g. a sound card or a National Instruments board) or from processed data such as the output from a filter, another decimator, etc.\nTo configure the decimator, go to the Detection&gt;“your decimator name …”&gt; menu\n\n\n\nDecimator Dialog\n\n\nSelect the input data source and specify the sample rate of the output data.\n\n\nFilter Settings\nIt is important that data are filtered correctly prior to decimation, otherwise aliasing will occur: that’s when higher frequencies in the data ‘fold’ down onto lower frequencies. You therefore need to filter the data at half the sample rate of the output data. Pressing the default button will generate a 6 pole Butterworth filter at the right frequency. If you want to do something different, you can press the filter settings dialog and the filter dialog will appear (see the Filters Design help page).\n\n\nInterpolation\nPAMGuard can handle decimation to frequencies which are not an exact submultiple of the original frequency, e.g. from a 500kHz input sample rate, to 48kHz output sample rate.\nIf you are decimating to a frequency that is not a submultiple, then you should consider using interpolation to improve the quality of the output data. Linear interpolation will use data points either side of the required sample point, quadratic will use the three closest samples. Both these methods use a small additional amount of CPU.",

Although a beamformer can calculate up to 3 different dimensions of data for each time slice (primary angle, secondary angle and frequency), only primary angle versus time is displayed in the spectrogram. To do this, the beamformer data is averaged over the frequency and secondary angle for each primary angle bin.\n\n\nStandard Spectrogram, showing the FFT Engine output.\nBeamogram Display, showing primary angle versus time with the amplitude represented by the colour.\n\nThe image above shows a simulated right whale call generated 90 degrees from the ship’s heading, and captured with a 16 channel array. The gain is proportional to the number of channels being combined, so with fewer channels the spread in amplitude will decrease. This means that, with smaller arrays, it may be difficult to visually see the angle with the highest amplitude as the display will look more like vertical bars of the same (or similar) colour.\nPrevious: Beamformer Algorithm Configuration",

    "section": "Notes and Warnings",
    "text": "Notes and Warnings\n\nLaptops\nThe audio quality of many sound cards is very poor and some, particularly those built into laptops which are prone to picking up electrical noise from the motherboard.\n\n\nUSB\nMany external sound cards connect using USB. While convenient, we have often experienced problems with USB sound cards ‘dropping’ data. This happens more when the computer is busy (which it will be when you’re running PAMGuard). These drop outs can result in the lost of several percent of your audio input data.\nIf you are using a laptop and need an external sound card, try to get one that connects using Firewire (IEEE 1394).\n\n\nSample Rate Conversions\nThe Windows drivers are clever. That’s not a good thing ! They are designed such that multiple applications on your computer can all use the same sound card, and all think they are using it at different sample rates, all at the same time. This is of course impossible.\nWhat’s really happening is that the sound card is sampling at one sample rate, and Windows is converting the data to whatever sample rate you’ve requested. This means that your beautiful high frequency data that you sampled at 192 kHz may actually be sampling the data at 48kHz and then up-sampling to 192kHz again without you knowing it. This will of course destroy all data at higher frequencies.\nIn windows 11, it’s reasonably easy to get around this, by going to the “Sound Settings” part of the control panel.\n\nIn this case, I want to configure the E1DA Cosmos ADC PCM32/384 card, so click on the little arrow to the right of that card to open the advanced properties controls for that card.\nYou can also see that the card I want to use with PAMGuard is not the default device for my laptop. That is a good thing ! It means that any beeps or boings that Windows want’s to make are going to go to a different device to the one I’m using for data collection.\n\nYou can see that the card is currently set to sample 2 channels, 16 bit, at 48kHz which is what it’s going to do, even though I want to sample at a higher frequency.\n\nFrom the drop down list of formats select the sample rate and data quality that you want, close the dialogs and test.\nAlways check that the card is really doing what you want it to do by running a spectrogram display on the raw data to ensure that you genuinely do have data at high frequencies.\nSome manufacturers provide alternative Windows drivers which you should use wherever possible.\nIf possible, test your sound card with a signal generator while viewing a spectrogram of the data to check that the high frequency data are OK\n\n\nUnwanted, unexpected and unnecessary filters\nMost sound cards are designed for human audio. Since we can’t hear much above about 15kHz (our children and pets may be able to do a bit better) some sound card manufacturers include a filter at around 20kHz and even if the software is allowing you to sample at high sample rates, you may not be getting any data through at high frequencies\nIdeally use a sound card where the manufacturer has published a technical specification showing a flat frequency response over the range you’re interested in. As with sample rate conversions, test your sound card with a signal generator while viewing a spectrogram of the data to check that the high frequency data are OK\n\n\nCalibration\nMost sound cards do not come with calibration information.\nIf calibration is important, you’ll have to do this yourself. Note though that settings may change depending on any adjustments made to the computers audio settings (e.g. from the windows mixer).\nPrevious: Acquisition Configuration\nNext: Asio Sound Cards",

The click train classifier extracts sequences of successive clicks that are likely from the same source, e.g a dolphin, porpoise or echo sounder.

The datagram shows the frequency density of CPOD/FPOD clicks constructed from the peak frequency parameter for each click The datagram can be useful for quickly navigating to sections of data that may contain porpoises and/or dolphins.\nIndividual CPOD detections can be viewed in the Time base display in PAMGuard. Add the CPOD module to a plot and then data can be viewed with time using a selection y-axis options such as Amplitude, Amplitude (stem), Frequency, bandwidth etc.\n\n\nFPOD data visualised in the time base display as a stem plots like FPOD.exe (top) and as a scatter plot of click amplitudes (bottom)",

This module can be used with any sensors that have an analog voltage or current output. Analog devices have the advantage over digitital devices in that they don’t introduce electrical noise into the hydrophone signals. If you are interested in digital accelerometers (e.g. in a fully digital array) then please contact the PAMGuard development team.\nThe system will allow for one set of sensors per hydrophone streamer. Depth and orientation data will be applied to all hydrophones within that streamer.\nTwo different types of data acquisition devices are currently supported:\n\nMeasurementComputing data acquisition cards (www.mccdaq.com) which can connect to a PC or laptop via USB;\nBrain Boxes ED-549 devices , which connect via Ethernet.\n\nDepth, Heading, Picth and Roll information is passed to the hydrophone array manager which makes it available to other PAMGuard modules as required.\n\nLogging\nIf you are using the PAMGuard Database, changes to the streamer configuration will automatically be logged in the hydrophonestreamers database table.\nNext: Configuration",

    "text": "Central to the software design is a flexible core architecture which allows the integration of a range of additional plugins. This provides you with flexibility, allowing you to tailor PAMGuard to your particular PAM operation.\nKey elements of the PAMGuard Core Functionality are:\n\nGUI Framework for PAMGuard displays and configuration options\n\nPAMGuard is an interactive cetacean detection and tracking environment with a variety of displays used both to configure and to display the output of a wide variety of detectors, mapping tools and sound processing modules.\n\nData manager and profiler\n\nA typical PAMGuard configuration will contain many data processing modules which produce many different types of data. The Data Manager handles all types of data, making data available to multiple displays and processes and also handling deletion and clean up of data from memory. It will also tell you how much computer power each process is using\n\nHydrophone array configuration and location manager\n\nPAMGuard contains a sophisticated hydrophone array manager, which can manage towed hydrophones, rigidly mounted hydrophones and fixed (i.e. bottom mounted) arrays.\n\nConfiguration and settings manager\n\nThe configuration manager offers an easy to use graphical depiction of loaded PAMGuard modules and the data flow between them. Configurations are stored in a format which can easily be sent between users or downloaded from the Internet.\n\nHelp manager\n\nPAMGuard contains comprehensive online help. If you’re reading this, then you’ve already found it, so press on …\nThe extensible nature of PAMGuard allows developers to easily add to PAMGuard’s functionalities. For instance, a developer who wishes to make a detector that requires spectrogram data as input can subscribe to an existing module that computes FFT’s and spectrogram information, which in turn will make use of PAMGuard’s sound acquisition modules to read data from a sound card, file, or some other input device. The PAMGuard data manager and GUI will then display and store output data from their detector with a minimum of programming effort through the use of standardised detection and data handling class structures.\nPrevious: PAMGuard Background\nNext: PAMGuard Modules",

In this case, PAMGuard can be set up to process the data as fast as it can, or slowed down so that you can listen to the data as they are being processed.\n\nRunning PAMGuard\n(If you’re reading this, you’ve probably already worked this out !)\nIf you’ve used one of the platform dependent installers (Windows and Mac), then you should start PAMGuard from one of the shortcuts placed in your system menus.\nIf you are running one of the platform independent jar files (Linux), then you should tell the JAVA virtual machine to allocate as much memory as possible. For instance, under Windows, the command line for starting PAMGuard Beta version 1.3.02 with 4 Gigabyte2 of memory is:\njava -jar -mx4096m PAMGuardBeta_2_02_15.jar PAMGuard\n\n\nThe PSFX File\nPAMGuard saves it’s configuration between runs in PAMGuard Settings Files (.psfx).\nEach time you start PAMGuard a dialog will open asking you to select the psfx file you want to use.\n\n\n\nPAMGuard Configuration Launch Dialog\n\n\nEither select a recently used psfx from the drop down list or press the browse button to select a psfx file stored elsewhere on your system.\nSample psfxx files may be downloaded from the www.pamguard.org web site.\n\n\nPAMGuard WatchDog\nWhen collecting and processing data in real time you can use the PAMGuard WatchDog to keep PAMGuard running whatever happens\n\n\nBatch Processing\nIf you’re processing sets of data offline, you can use the Batch Processing Plugin to run the same configuration file on several different sets of data.\nPrevious: PAMGuard Modules\nNext: PAMGuard Viewer.",

Either the GPS has no output, the serial port is incorrectly configured, there is a problem with the antenna or there is a wiring problem between the GPS and computer.\n[Back to the top]\nI can’t find the correct serial port\nIf you have no serial ports or too many serial ports in the NMEA Configuration Dialog and are using a serial to USB converter check that the drivers are correctly installer. On Windows machines, look in the control panel for unknown USB devices. If you’re having trouble identifying the right port, then it may be worth restarting PAMGuard with and without the converter plugged in to see which ports appear and disappear from the list in the NMEA Configuration Dialog.\n[Back to the top]\nThe GPS makes my mouse/cursor go crazy !\nWhen a Windows PC starts up and a GPS or other NMEA device is connected, the Plug and Play system thinks that a serial mouse or trackball has been installed. The system then starts to interpret NMEA messages as mouse movements. Your cursor seems to jump all over the place and it becomes impossible to control your machine.\nTo solve this problem either temporarily or permanently, do one of the following:\n\nMake sure the GPS is either switched off or is not plugged in when you start your system.\nStart the system with the GPS plugged in and switched on - your system will recognise it as a mouse or trackball and go a bit crazy. Before it manages to click on anything too important unplug or switch off your GPS. This will enable you to control your system without the GPS creating random cursor movements. Go into the control panel, select the mouse icon, go to the hardware tab and you will see your normal mouse or mice listed as well as the annoying phantom mouse which is really the GPS. You can disable it in this dialog by selecting the phantom mouse, clicking on the properties button and disabling it at the bottom of the properties dialog. You only have to do this once in the lifetime of your computer. Your system will then start normally whether the GPS is plugged in or not as you start up (i.e. it will continue to recognise the GPS as a mouse, but will know that it’s disabled and not use it). If you start your computer without the GPS plugged in, then the GPS will not appear in the list of mice in the control panel, so you can’t disable it in the way outlined above. I’ve done this on dozens of machines and it always seems to work and does not interfere in any way with other mice on your system - just make sure you disable the right one !\n\n[Back to the top]\nThe GPS isn’t outputting any data\nIf you’re convinced that the GPS is correctly connected any you still aren’t getting any data, then it’s possible that the GPS has been configured to either not output data at all, to output data in a different format or at a different baud rate.\nThis is unlikely with marine GPS’s, but many hand held devices are set to different communications protocols. Refer to the manufacturers hand book (or jab about randomly at the GPS’s menu options) and set it to output data in NMEA 0183 format at 4800 baud.\n[Back to the top]\nAll or some of the NMEA Strings are empty\nIf data are getting into the computer and you can see strings in the NMEA Strings List which are mostly lot’s of ,,,,,,,, then the most likely explanation is that you’ve no satellite signal. Check your antenna has a clear view of the sky. If your GPS has only been switched on for a few minutes and has moved a long distance since it was last switched on it may take some minutes to find satellites. Refer to the manufacturers handbook for further information.\n[Back to the top]",

    "text": "PAMGuard GPS & NMEA Overview\nGPS Data are output from GPS Receivers in National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) format. NMEA format Data are also output by many other ships instruments, such as wind instruments and echo sounder and also by AIS (Automatic Ship Identification) systems.\nNMEA is a standard specification for interface and data exchange between marine instruments. It allows ship’s instruments to “talk to” each other and to computers. For more detailed information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183.\nNMEA Data form older devices are generally sent in RS-232 protocols and can be input to a computer via a serial port. If your computer does not have a serial port (nowadays few laptops do), then it’s generally possible to use a serial to USB to serial converter. Most GPS systems now connect to your PC through a USB connection rather than the older 9 pin serial connection. Note though that these USB connections are still using the serial port protocol, it’s just that the Serial to USB converter has been built into the GPS. An incredibly annoying feature of these Serial / USB connectors is that if you plug them into a different UDB port on your computer, it will change the number of the virtual serial port, so whenever possible, plug them into the same port each time ! If the serial port number has changed, then you’ll need to go into the configuration dialog (see below) and select the correct port.\nGPS data are fundamental to PAMGuard in addition, several other useful data sources which may be useful to PAMGuard may be available in an NMEA data string and several PAMGuard modules, for instance the AIS Module may need to access NMEA data. Thus, PAMGuard has a module for accessing NMEA data and an additional module for GPS Processing which is dependent on an NMEA Acquisition module. If needed, you can have more than one NMEA module in your configuration, each connected to a different NMEA device, or you can get an NMEA multiplexor to combine NMEA data from multiple devices into a single data stream.\n\n\nAdding an NMEA Data Collection Module\nTo add a new NMEA Data Collection module to PAMGuard, select the File-&gt;Maps and Mapping-&gt;NMEA Data Collection menu item.\n\n\nSetting the NMEA Parameters\nFrom the Detection Menu, select NMEA Data Collection&gt;NMEA Parameters\n\n\n\nNmeaParametersDialog (17K)\n\n\n\nSimulated NMEA and AIS Data\nPAMGuard can also simulate NMEA GPS and AIS data. This is useful during training and setting up exercises. GPS Data are simulated according to a user defined start position, course and speed. AIS data are sampled from data collected in the English channel.\n\n\n\nChecking the NMEA data source\nTo verify the NMEA data source, select Detection&gt;NMEA Data Collection&gt;NMEA Strings\nThis will show the NMEA Strings List Dialog, an example of which is below.\n\n\n\nnmeaStringsListDialog (17K)\n\n\nThis dialog shows the current NMEA strings being acquired by PAMGuard. The update time and string ID are also shown. In the example above, a GPRMC string has been acquired.\nThe “Last update” time should update according to the time and date on your GPS receiver, or the simulated date if in simulation mode. If this is not the case, please check all cables and connections and re-try. If using the NMEA Server utility, check that the NMEA output strings are updating.\n\n\nHints and Solutions\nSetting up NMEA isn’t always as straight forward as it might be.\nSome information on making connections to an NMEA signal can be found here.\nSome troubleshooting FAQ’s and solutions are here.\nNext: Configuring GPS",

    "text": "PAMGuard is capable of localising target motion data utilising multiple algorithms. In order to do so click trains must be marked out as described in the Click Detector Viewer Functions section. Once a click train has been marked as an event it can be localised either by right clicking on a click and selecting ‘Localise Click Train idxxx’ or selecting ‘Target Motion Analysis..’ from the ‘Click Detection’ drop down menu. This will open the target motion dialog panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Target Motion Analysis Panel consists of four sections.\nEvent Selection\nThe Event Selection panel is located at the top of the Target Motion Analysis window. The drop down menu allows different events to be selected.The ‘Run’ and ‘Run all’ button will attempt to localise each event using the selected localisation algorithms. Once the localisation algorithm(s) have run the results can be saved into the current database using the ‘Save’ button, disregarded using the ‘Keep Old’ button, or disregarded and if there are previous results, deleted, from the database using the ‘Set Null’ button.\nModel Control\nModel control allows the selection of different localisation algorithms described in the Target Motion Localisation Algorithms section. By default no algorithms are selected.\nMap\nThe Map shows the trackline, bearing vectors to the source for each detected vocalisation and anylocalisation results. The Map can be switched between 2D and 3D views by selecting the 2D Map and 3D Map buttons at the top of the panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n3D Sperm Whale (14K)\n\n\nThe 2D map shows a birds eye view of the event with ability to zoom using the mouse wheel and drag using either the left or right mouse buttons. Localisation results are represented as 2D symbols with a black line representing the perpendicular distance to the trackline. Figure 2 shows a 2D Map example of a sperm whale encounter with all four algorithms used to localise.\nThe 3D map is similar but with the ability to manipulate and rotate the map through three dimensions using the left mouse button. The 3D map also allows an intuitive display of the localisation errors calculated by each algorithm. Least Squares and Simplex2D/3D algorithms display the localisation results as translucent three dimensional ellipses with dimensions corresponding to the calculated localisation errors. For the MCMC algorithm each Markov chain is represented by a blue track showing an accurate probability distribution of the source location. Figure 3 shows the same encounter and localisation results as in Figure 2 but represented using the 3D map. A large MCMC probability distribution and Simplex3D ellipse show the likely source location in 3D with the 2D Simplex and Least Squares algorithms represented by yellow and black 3D ellipses on the sea surface.\nRight clicking on either map will create a drop down menu with options to return the map to the original view, rotate by 90 degrees or change the length of the bearing vectors.\nResults\nThe results pane shows the localisation results for each attempted algorithm. The algorithm which best fits the data is automatically selected however this can be changed by selecting the checkbox of any other result. The data from the selected result is saved to the connected database when the ‘Save’ button is pressed in the Event Selection panel.

    "text": "PAMGuard allows the user to select a number of localisation algorithms for target motion analysis. The mathematical basis behind these algorithms can be found in the Localisation Techniques section.\nThe Localisation algorithms utilised in target motion analysis are either 2D or 3D in nature. A 2D algorithm does not consider depth as a variable and will attempt to find the most likely position of the source on the sea surface. A 3D algorithm attempts to localise in all three dimensions.\nReferring to the Target Motion Overview section, a single paired hydrophone array will often result in a circular probability distribution of the source location. In 2D this circle become two points and hence the 2D localisation algorithms will often have two results, one for each of the possible points. The straightness of the trackline and uncertainty in hydrophone positions dictates how similar in likelihood each of these results is. Often it will be ambiguous as to which is the more correct location of the animal.\nAlgorithm Description\nLeast Squares The least squares algorithm is the least computationally intense of the four. It will only work if the track is relatively straight. The first step of the computation is to fit a straight line to the GPS data and then to project all bearings from that straight line. By using a straight line approximation, it is then possible to use a simple linear regression of the 1/tan(bearing angle) to the animal against their position along the track-line to compute a perpendicular distance and a position along the track-line (Gillespie and Chappell 2002). The regression is carried out for an animal on each side of the trackline and the side with the lowest chi squared taken as the most likely position, where chi squared is the sum of the squares of the difference in measured angles to true angles to the location divided by the expected bearing errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplex2D The 2D simplex method, as it’s name implies, uses the Nelder-Mead Simplex optimisation algorithm (available in the apache commons library ) to minimise the chi squared function, where the chi squared is again the sum of the squared differences between the expected and measured angles to any animal location. The difference between the Simplex and the Least Squares method is that the Simplex method can handle large changes in vessel heading. To achieve this however, the algorithm cannot calculate the animal position directly, but must use the Simplex search method which tests many possible positions until it finds the one with the lowest chi squared . While more flexible than the Least Squares method, this inevitably takes considerably longer to execute. The errors calculated by this algorithm are derived from the uncertainty in position of each hydrophone element. These can be set in the hydrophone array manager window .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplex3D Simplex3D is the 3D version of the Simplex2D algorithm and a very fast 3D localiser. The errors calculated by this algorithm are also derived from the uncertainty in position of each hydrophone element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCMC MCMC is a 3D localisation algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. It is a very computationally intensive algorithm, however, shows the most accurate probability distribution of the source location. The algorithm is extremely sensitive to errors and has several settings which need changed depending on the range distribution of localisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MCMC localiser uses the errors in hydrophone element positions set in the hydrophone array manager window and the expected error in the time delay measurements to calculate the likely probability distribution of the source location. The error in time delay measurements will generally come from cross correlating two digitised waves and for most species will be around 1 sample. For species, such as harbour porpoises, with narrowband clicks this error should be increased.\nThe time delay error and other settings for the MCMC localiser can be accessed from the MCMC ‘Settings’ tab in the model control panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Error\nSet the error in time delays. Generally this will be 1 sample although for narrowband species this should be set to around 5 samples.\nMax Jump Size\nThe length of each MCMC jump is a random number between 0 and Max Jump Size. If the jump size is set too low it will take the algorithm a long time to find the source location. If the jump size is set too high the probability distribution will not ‘flesh out’ properly. As a rule of thumb the maximum jump size should be 1/100 of the maximum expected detection range.\nNumber of Jumps\nThe number of attempted jumps. The more jumps the longer the computation time. If the number of jumps is set too low the algorithm will not ‘flesh out’ the probability distribution of the source location properly and may not reach the source location at all. For 3D localisation without any additional parameters 250000 jumps is usually sufficient.\nNumber of Chains\nThe number of Markov Chains used to localise. More chains means more accurate results and will also show whether there is a potential 3D ambiguity in the source location. Each chain runs on separate processor thread.\nChain Start Dispersion\nEach Markov chain begins in a random location. The maximum range of these random location is set by Chain Start Dispersion. Generally this should be the maximum detection range of the species in question.\nCylindrical Co-Ordinates\nSwitching from a Cartesian to a Cylindrical Co-Ordinate system allows MCMC to flesh out circular probability distributions more efficiently.\nPrevious: Localising an Event\nNext: Results",

    "text": "Add the MEAL localiser and localise porpoise clicks. Batch process the entire dataset and view in a spread sheet. Create a graph of the dive profile.\n\n3.1 Set up the localiser\nNow we have detected and classified our porpoise clicks we can begin to localise. The MEAL localiser module is currently still under development and can only be accessed in PAMGuard viewer. This partly due to the fact that localisation is computationally intensive and so currently not suitable for real time use.\nFor this exercise we are going to use some data already prepared so that all participants are using the same classification settings etc. Start a new instance of PAMGuard viewer mode, open the database named PorpFineScalePAMTech in the Exercise 3 folder and select the corresponding binary files in the folder named 20120630.\nGo to File &gt; Add Modules &gt; Loclaisers &gt; MEAL localiser. This will add the MEAL localiser to viewer mode. As the module is still in development there are a few minor issues which need to be sorted out when adding the module. Your instructor will guide you through these.\nYou should end up with a new localiser tab which looks like.\n\nFigure 14. The MEAL localiser should initially look something like this.\nFor the rest of this exercise we will divide the localiser into panels and refer to each panel by the names given below.\n\n1) Data block selection menu\n\nClick bt display\n\nAlgorithm selection\n\nDetection match | 5) Localiser controls\n\nMap\n\nAlgorithm display\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top Click bt display panel contains a miniature bearing time display however since we did not group any of our clicks there is no bearing information to display. Right click on the display, select Bearing Amplitude Options and in the dialog box select Amplitude.\n\nFigure 15. Because we did not group clicks we will need to view them on an amplitude time rather than bearing time display.\nThe Click bt display panel should now look similar to your main Click Detector bearing time display. Select Porpoise in the Filter Species box. This tells the localiser to only use classified porpoise clicks in calculations.\nThe Map panel displays localisation results and shows the hydrophone array. Right click to drag the map, left click to rotate and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Your display should now look something like.\n\nFigure 16. Use the mouse left click, right click and wheel to manipulate the 3D map.\nSelect a porpoise click. You should notice the Detection match panel changing. The Detection match panel contains information on the number of possible time delay combinations. The red circle represents the selected detection, in this case whichever click you have selected in the Click bt Display. This selected detection is your primary detection. We need to find this detection on other hydrophones; to do this we look in a time window before and after the time of the primary detection, represented in the panle by a grey line. Each hydrophone will have a different time window depending on how far it is away from the primary hydrophone. It is possible that a time window will contain more than one detection and for species such as a harbour porpoise, which has indistinguishable clicks, there is a an equal likelihood that any one click within the time window could be the primary click we are looking for. The blue dots represent the possible matches to the primary click within the time windows. Each blue line represents a possible combination of detections of which only one will contain only detections which correspond to the primary detection. The number of possibilities is shown at the top of the window.\n | Reasons for multiple time delay possibilities\n-echoes\n-multiple animals\n-rapid vocalisations\n-widely spaced elements | |—-|—-|\nFigure 17. The number of possible time delay combinations is displayed in the Detection match panel. Lines represent each combination and the red dot represents the currently selected detection.\nFor this exercise we are only going to use the vertical component of the array to determine depth and range. This will reduce the number of time delay possibilities and give us information on depth and range. In the localiser controls panel select Options and in the Channels tab deselect channels 6, 7, 8 and 9. In the Map tab make sure that Use high res. Plot symbols is selected. Click OK.\n\nFigure 18. For this exercise we only need channels 0-5 selected.\n\n\n3.2 Localise a click\nWe are now going to perform our first localisation. Select MCMC in the Algorithm selection panel. You should see the Localise, Localise All, and Stop buttons becoming enabled. Find a click which contains corresponding detections on most other channels and has more than one time delay possibility. In the detection match panel such a click should look something like…\n\nFigure 19. Select a click which has time delay possibilities roughly similar to this.\nFirst we are going to localise only one combination. Click the Localise Button.\n\nFigure 20. MCMC produces a circular probability distribution. This is exactly what would be expected from a linear array.\nYou should notice a circular ‘cloud’ appear on the map. This cloud corresponds to the probability distribution of the porpoises’ location calculated by the MCMC algorithm. The cloud is circular because a linear array only allows us to determine depth and range.\n\nFigure 21. Using the map you can view the circle side on. Note it has a well-defined depth.\nAlign the map horizontally and you will see the circle has well defined depth. The range corresponds to the radius of the circle. The ability of MCMC to automatically determine these distributions is one of its primary strengths.\nYou will notice that the results panel contains summary information on the position of the animal including its depth, range and corresponding errors.\n\n\n3.2.1 Localise all Combinations\nNow we are going to localise all possible combinations of time delays and by doing so we can check which combination is correct. Localise by pressing Localise All. The localiser will now localise all the possible combinations. Once the localiser has stopped your screen should look something like…\n\nFigure 22. You can localise all possible time delay combination for a given detection. The result which has the lowest chi squared value is also likely the correct combination of detections.\nWe now have multiple clouds, some which have the expected circular shape and others which do not. Instantly, just by eye, you can see some combinations produce better results than others. Click on one of the clouds. It will turn red along with its corresponding time delay combination in the _Detection matc_h panel. Clicking on a combination or map symbol will also highlight the corresponding localisation result in the Results panel. The algorithm display panel has an MCMC tab. If selected this will show you a graph of chi squared versus ‘jump iteration’.\n\n\n\nThe highlighted series here has the lowest average chi squared value and hence is the best fit result. By selecting it in this panel the corresponding cloud in the map and time delay combination in the detection match panel will be highlighted.\n\n\nThe quicker this graph reaches a low chi squared value the better the time delay information has fit the algorithm. You can also use this panel to highlight corresponding detection match lines and plot symbols; it is a handy way of picking the combination which has the lowest final chi squared value.\n\nFigure 23. You can select 3D shapes on the map and time delay possibilities in the detection match panel.\nIn the results panel the result with lowest chi squared value will be ticked. This result is the best fit to the algorithm which likely indicates it was calculated from the correct combination of time delays. You can save this result by pressing Save.\nYou have now learned the basics of the MEAL localiser. It is vital you familiarise yourself with this so take a while to localise other clicks.\n\n\n3.3 Simplex Localisation\nThe Simplex algorithm is similar to MCMC however does not show true probability distributions. It is, however much faster. Select Simplex in the Algorithm selection panel and compare it to the MCMC algorithm by localising a few more clicks. Pay attention to the millis column in the results table. This shows the computational time of each algorithm.\n\nFigure 24. Simplex is much faster than MCMC but doesn’t perform quite as well.\n\n\n3.4 Batch Process Data\nIn this section we will batch process the entire dataset. In doing so we will localise every porpoise click and save to a database. To save time we will be using the Simplex algorithm, however analysis with MCMC will produce better results. Make sure Simplex is the only algorithm selected in the Algorithm selection panel. Select Batch Process and tick the Batch Localise box and ensure All Data is selected in the Data Options drop down menu. Next select Settings…\n\nIn the Batch Process Tab select Use a primary hydrophone box and set the Primary Hydrophone as 4.Using a primary hydrophone means that only clicks on one channel are processed. This ensures that localisations are not repeated across different channels. Set the Min no. of time delays to 4. Min. number of delays specifies the minimum number of channels which must have a click detected. Note delays are related to channels by 0.5+sqrt(1+2*TD)/2 were TD is the number of time delays. There is no point in localising a click which was only detected on one other channel, as this simply gives you one time delay and hence a hyperbolic cone of infinite size on which a porpoise may be located i.e. not much localisation information.\nNext select the General tab and ensure that Display only lowest chi2 value is selected. This means that only the localisation result with the lowest chi squared value will be saved from clicks which have multiple possible combinations.\n\nIn the General tab you can export data to a spread sheet. This is not necessary as data is automatically saved to a database, however is convenient in many cases to quickly open data in excel. Tick Save to.csv and specify a path using Browse. Click OK.\nNow click Start and wait until the data processing is complete.\n\n\n3.5 View results\nOnce the batch processing has finished open the spread sheet you specified in section 3.4. Using Microsoft Excel or equivalent select the chi column and filter out any values above 3. Now selected the z column and plot a graph of results with time. You should end up with something which looks roughly like….\n\nFigure 25. Your results with the Simplex algorithm should look something like this graph.\nWell done. You have calculated a porpoise dive profile from raw .wav data. MCMC produces slightly better result. If you have time you can try and replicate these by batch processing with MCMC.\n\nFigure 26. MCMC captures more of the dive.\nPrevious: Exercise2 - View Data\nNext: Geo referencing 3D localisations"

    "text": "Process 10 channel .wav files using the click detector to detect porpoises and create binary files\n\n1.1 Create the Module Structure\nTo begin we need to analyse the raw .wav data in PAMGuard. Start PAMGuard in normal mode. Select File &gt; Add Modules &gt; Sound Processing &gt; Sound Acquisition to add the sound acquisition module. This will allow the raw .wav files to be analysed in PAMGuard. Next we need a click detector. Go to File &gt; Add Modules &gt; Detector &gt; Click Detector. The click detector module should now appear. Finally we need a database (File &gt; Add Modules &gt; Utilities &gt; Database) and binary storage (File &gt; Add Modules &gt; Utilities &gt; Binary Store).\nNow you have added the modules the next stage is to set up everything. Your data model should look like.\n\nFigure 1 The data model should look roughly like this to analyse clicks.\nIn PAMGuard you always move from modules on the left to modules on the right when inputting settings. So here we start with sound acquisition and then move to the click detector. Select Detection &gt; Sound Acquisition… In the dialog box set the audio source to Audio file or multiple file, select Select Folder or Files… and choose the folder containing the porpoise .wav files. Now that the sound acquisition knows you are dealing with ten channels of data you will need to create a ten channel hydrophone array in the array manager. Go to File &gt; Hydrophone Array… and use Import. to select the ten channel array file for this porpoise data. (In Exercise 1-2 folder) The hydrophone array manager dialog box should look like.\n\nFigure 2. Hydrophone array manager.\n\n\n1.2 Set up the Click Detector Params\nNow set up the click detector. Go to the Click Detection menu on the main screen and select Detection Parameters…. We want to detect clicks on all channels so select the check box for all ten channels. Make sure that no grouping is selected. This is usually sensible for wide aperture arrays (see note). Select the Trigger tab and ensure check boxes are selected for every channel. This ensures each channel individually runs the click detection algorithm. Click OK.\n \nFigure 3. Make sure the channels are not grouped and all selected in the trigger tab.\n\n\n1.3 Create filters to optimise for Porpoise Click Detection\nNow we want to set up filters to optimise our chances of finding porpoise clicks. There are two filters in the click detector, a pre filter and digital trigger filter. The pre filter filters the raw sound data used by the click detector module. We want to get rid of low frequency noise so a high pass filter at 20kHz is ideal. Select Click Detection &gt; Digital Pre Filter… In the dialog which pops up create a high pass Butterworth filter at 20000Hz.\n\nFigure 4. The digital pre filter should be set to 20kHz, high pass.\nNow we need to set the digital trigger filter. The digital trigger filter is only used by the algorithm which searches for clicks. The final saved click waveforms and spectra are taken from the raw sound data filtered only by the pre filter. Since porpoises have narrow band high frequency clicks it is sensible to search for clicks only in a narrow frequency band. Hence our digital trigger filter will be a band pass, from 100kHz to 150kHz. Select Click Detection &gt; Digital trigger filter… In the dialog which pops up create a band pass Chebyshev filter between 100000 and 150000Hz.\n\nFigure 5. The digital trigger filter should be a band pass between 100 and 150kHz.\n\n\n1.4 Create a porpoise click classifier\nThe click detector is now set up to detect clicks in the porpoise frequency range. However, although we have optimised the click detector for porpoise like vocalisations it will still detect many different types of sounds. In order to determine whether porpoise are present we need to classify clicks. For this we can use the PAMGuard click classifier. Go to Click Detection &gt; Click Classification. In the Click Classifier Selection drop down box select Classifier with frequency sweep. Select New to bring up a new click classifier settings dialog. In the bottom of the dialog box use the Set Defaults button to create default porpoise parameters. Click OK.\n\nFigure 6. The click classifier has default settings for porpoise clicks.\nYou’ve now created a porpoise click classifier. To ensure that classifier is applied to data make sure that the Run classification online and Enable check boxes are selected.\n\nFigure 7. Click classifier manager.\n\n\n1.5 Running\nWe have now set the detector click detector up to detect and classifiy porpoise vocalisations. To run select Detection &gt; Start\n\nFigure 8. The click detector running through the ten channel .wav files should look something like the above.\nA note on groups. In many detectors you have the option of “grouping channels”. Grouping tells PAMGuard to automatically calculate extra information for those channels which have been selected as belonging to a group. Grouped channels are saved as a single data unit containing information from each channel. For example, a towed array contains two closely spaced hydrophones. These two channels, when analysed in PAMGuard, are usually grouped. If a click is detected on one of the hydrophones then a waveform clip is also automatically recorded from the other channel; this is then saved as a data unit containing information on both channels. PAMGuard can calculate extra information for any data unit which contains more than channel of information. For our towed array, two clicks allow bearing information to be calculated for bearing time displays and target motion analysis. In general widely spaced hydrophones are not grouped.\nPrevious: Overview.html\nNext: Exercise2 - View Data"

    "text": "The Group 3D Localiser is designed for 2D (latitude and longitude or x and y) and 3D (latitude, longitude and depth or x, y and depth) localisation using wide aperture arrays.\nWith a wide aperture array, there is an implicit assumption that a detection on one hydrophone is no guarantee of detections on other hydrophones, either because the sound source was too far from some of the hydrophones, the sound source was too directional, or noise local to one or more hydrophones was too high for detection to be possible.\nFurthermore, by their nature, wide aperture arrays are large compared to the duration of a typical sound being detected (this is true whatever the species, for example with harbour porpoise a ‘wide’ aperture array may only be a few metres across, which equates to a few milliseconds travel time, but porpoise clicks are less than 100�s long; similarly baleen whale sounds may be a couple of seconds long, but arrays for baleen whales are likely to be spread over many km).\nThe Group 3D localiser is therefore used with detectors configured to detect independently on individual hydrophones or compact hydrophone clusters. It then looks for possible matches of detections between available hydrophones, based on time of arrival differences, and forms groups of detections which are then passed to the localisation algorithm. If an array is large, the possible time of arrival of a sound on multiple hydrophones may be great enough that there are multiple possible matches of detected sounds between the various hydrophones. This problem is known as spatial aliasing and may make localisation of some sounds impossible.\nCareful array design, considering animal vocalisation rate, overall call rate if many animals are likely to be present, detection range, sound directionality, the extent of the study area, and number of hydrophones to use is therefore required if this localiser is to be successfully employed.\n\nDevice Synchronisation\nMost of the algorithms rely on Time Difference of Arrival of signals at multiple hydrophones. If the hydrophones are autonomous recorders deployed some distance apart, then it is likely that their clocks will be running at slightly different rates and methods must be employed to accurately measure these clock offsets and to account for them when merging files from separate recorders into multi channel files for analysis. How accurately clocks need to be synchronised depends on the size of the array. As a rule of thumb, clock synchronisation should aim to be better than 1% of the time separation of the hydrophones. So if you’re hydrophones are several km apart, then a few milliseconds time offset may be acceptable. A smaller array will require more accurate synchronisation.\n\n\nSimulating Success\nWhen considering using the Group 3D Localiser a great way of testing a configuration is to set up a simulated sound source. This allows you to test out configurations with high signal to noise ratio sounds at known locations. While the simulation is somewhat idealised and a combination of detectors and localisers which work with simulated data is no guarantee that the configuration will work with real data, if a configuration doesn’t work with simulated data, the chances of it working with real data are going to be impossibly low.\nA series of demonstration configurations, all using simulated data, are being developed and made available through the PAMGuard website. You may want to take a look at these before developing your own configuration.\nNext: Configuration",

It’s also worth reading Spiesberger (2001) which gives an explanation of the minimum number of hydrophones required for 2D and 3D localisation.\nPAMGuard contains both 2D and 3D implementations of the algorithm and will automatically select the appropriate version depending on the shape of the hydrophone array.\nA hyperbola is calculated for each pair of hydrophones from the time delay between that hydrophone pair. This requires that accurate time delays can be calculated for the sounds being detected, so accurate time synchronisation for all hydrophones is important.

This should be at least the minimum number required by the selected algorithm, but may be higher depending on the number of hydrophones you think detections should occur on. If sounds are far apart in time and the detector is working well then there will be one detection per channel and a group with that number of detections will form. However, detections may not occur on all hydrophones and some hydrophones may have more than one detection (if sounds were being produces at a high rate, or there are false detections). The initial grouping is based purely on what may be possible based on the time of arrival differences between the different hydrophones. In a worst-case-scenario a group might become infinitely long, so a maximum number of sounds allowed in a group can also be specified.\n\n\nData selection\nSome detectors have a built in data selector (for instance the Click Detector, when used with it’s click classifier allows you to select only clicks that meet certain classification criteria, the Whistle and Moan detector allows you to select whistles based on their duration and frequency range, etc.).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many localisers use Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) of signals on multiple hydrophones to estimate locations, whether it be just a bearing calculation, or a full 3D location. Even when using localisation algorithms such as the Group 3D Localiser Crossed Bearing algorithm it’s likely that the bearings being crossed will have been derived from TDOA measurements.\nTDOA measurements are most often made by finding the peak in the cross correlation function of the signal waveform recorded at each hydrophone.\nTDOA measurement are more accurate for louder signals and can be made more accurate through careful filtering of data, up-sampling, and interpolation (Gillespie and Macaulay, 2019).\nExactly how PAMGuard calculates a TDOA for a given detector depends slightly on the type of detection, what data are included with the detection and also on how far apart hydrophones are spaced.\n\nClicks\nTransient sounds from the click detector are stored with a short waveform clip which is used for TDOA measurement. There are a number of options available to control how the TDOA measurement is made, broadly following the examples in Gillespie and Macaulay (2019). It is also possible to select different settings (e.g. different frequency ranges for filtering) based on the classification of individual detected clicks.\n\nTiming configuration options for the click detector are available from within the main Settings dialog of the Click Detector, or through a settings button in the configuration of the Group 3D localiser when a TDOA based algorithm is selected.\n\n\nSpectrogram based detectors\nSeveral detectors, including the Whistle and Moan detector and the GPL detector search a spectrogram of audio data to detect sounds. These detectors tend not to store the waveform of the detected sound (as is the case for the click detector) but do often store the time-frequency contour of the detection. For these detectors, TDOA’s are calculated from the Complex FFT data used as input to the detection algorithm. Note that this is mathematically the same as a waveform cross correlation, so time resolution (with interpolation) is still better than a single sample, and is NOT the time resolution of the FFT data frames. For detectors providing detailed time-frequency contour information, the cross correlation is restricted to the frequency limits of the detection.\nGenerally, there are no options controlling how the cross correlation of the spectrogram data is conducted, but some localisers may need you to select the correct source of FFT data appropriate to the detector.\nLocalisers requiring a time delay will calculate the maximum possible time delay between two hydrophones. If this time delay is less than half the length of an FFT frame, then the cross correlation is simply the sum of the cross correlations of all FFT frames included in the detection, with a 1:1 match between the FFT frames from the different channels of data. Where the maximum time delay is greater than half a FFT frame, then data from each pair of channels will be ‘slid’ across one another, and the total cross correlation calculated for all possible time delays, the best correlation value being selected.\nSome localisers also offer the option of selecting raw sound data for input to the TDOA calculation. In this instance, it will recalculate the FFT data, which is probably a waste of time if the FFT is already calculated.\n\n\nReferences\nGillespie, D., and Macaulay, J.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Generic Localisers are intended to work with any type of data from any PAMGuard detector. Some detectors, such as the Click Detector and the Whistle and Moan detector have built in bearing localisers and you should continue to use these. Most other detectors should use these generic localisers, and the 3D localiser can be used to estimate 2D and 3D locations for click and whistle data.\nSome localisers will work on a single sound, detected on multiple hydrophones.\nIn general terms, there are three types of localisation that are possible for single sounds:\n\nBearings - a bearing in one or two dimensions (e.g. horizontal angle and elevation angle), possibly with ambiguity either side of the hydrophone array.\n2D Localisations - a Latitude and Longitude, or x,y position relative to the hydrophone array.\n3D Localisations - Latitude, Longitude, and depth or x,y,z, positions relative to the hydrophone array.\n\nAnother type of localisation, called Target Motion Analysis, uses the movement of the vessel and assumes that multiple sounds from the same source can be linked together, it then crosses multiple bearings to the sound source to generate a position. Target Motion Analysis can provide localisations using simpler arrays, but it’s success is very dependent on animals producing regular vocalisations which can be linked together either automatically or by a human observer.\nThe type of localisation will depend a lot on the type and layout of the array, its overall dimensions, the number of individual hydrophones, whether they are laid out in a line, a plane, or distributed in three dimensions. Success will also be heavily influenced by the types of sound being detected, their signal to noise ratio (it’s easer if SNR is high!), the rate at which sounds are arriving (is it easy to match the different sounds on the different hydrophones, or are there many possibilities?), etc.\nOften there are fundamental trade-offs of compromises to be made. For example, when localising harbour porpoise, you’ll want to get the hydrophones quite far apart to cover the area or volume you’re interested in, but at the same time you’ll want the hydrophones quite close together or the highly directional sounds won’t be detected on sufficient hydrophones for localisation. In most studies using wide aperture arrays, there will always be sounds detected on the periphery of the array which are only detected on one or two hydrophones and can’t therefore be localised.\n\nSingle Sound Localisers\n\nBearing Localiser\nThe Bearing Localiser is designed to work with compact arrays of two or more hydrophones. Implicit in it’s operation is the assumption that hydrophones are close enough together that a sound detected on one hydrophone will also be present on others. Time delay measurements will be based on the cross correlation of the signals on the different channels and localisation will provide one or two bearings, depending on the type of array (linear, planar or volumetric).\nBearing localiser results are added as an annotation to the group detection and will be stored in both the database and in binary storage.\n\n\nGroup 3D Localiser\nThe Group 3D Localiser has been developed for use with wide aperture arrays of four or more hydrophones. It links separate detections from multiple hydrophones and offers a choice of algorithms for 2 or 3 dimensional localisation\nThe automatic grouping of multiple detections to form a localisation generates a new data output stream in PAMGuard which is written to the database. Each database record contains information on which detections were used in the localisation and the localisation result.\n\n\n\nMultiple Sound Localisers\n\nTarget Motion Localiser\nThe Target Motion Localiser can be used for 2D and 3D localisation using target motion analysis. It’s input must be grouped detections, where the grouping has either been done automatically, e.g. using the Click Train Detector, or manually using the Detection grouper. Detections within each group must have bearing information, e.g. from the Bearing Localiser. For a linear array, the localisation will generally be ambiguous about the array axis, so two separate locations may be calculated, one for each side. For compact volumetrica arrays, which produce unambiguous bearings, the resulting localisation will also be unambiguous.\nTarget motion results are added as an annotation to the group detection and will be stored in both the database and in binary storage.\n\n\nDetection grouper\nThe Detection grouper is not a localiser in itself, but can be used to manually group detections together on the PAMGuard displays for use with the Target Motion Localiser.\nThe detection grouper generates a new data output stream in PAMGuard which contains information on which detections were included in each group.\n\n\nExample configurations\nA selection of PAMGuard configuration files that illustate the use of some of the PAMGuard localisers with different detectors and types of array can be downloaded here.\nPrevious: Types of Array\nNext: Time Difference of Arrival",

    "text": "The Forward and Inverse Problem\nIn an ideal world the problem of localisation is barely a problem at all. Time delays can be calculated, bearings crossed and a location calculated. A rigorous and concise mathematical derivation of this is found in Magnus Wahlberg et al. However biological studies are not conducted in vacuum, seawater is not a still homogeneous medium and cetaceans are not perfectly spherical acoustic sources. As discussed in the localisation overview section error is inherent in every part of a hydrophone monitoring system, from the position of the hydrophone, to the digitisation and cross correlation of a detected porpoise click. Therefore instead of having cones, which perfectly intersect at the exact location of the cetacean, in reality there exists a set of cones, which roughly intersect each other in a certain area or perhaps do not intersect at all. This creates an obvious problem. If there is no exact intersection point, where is the cetacean?\nThe process of calculating and crossing bearings to find an intersection point is generally named the inverse problem. The inverse problem refers to a situation were for a given set of observations (time delays) the initial parameters (location of the cetacean) are directly calculated. The advantage of this system is that it is very computational efficient however, it is also particularly vulnerable to errors. Although cones may roughly intersect around a likely cetacean position, quantification of the error in location is difficult and therefore the inverse problem does not provide an intuitive or satisfactory solution to real world localisation. Instead for many localisation algorithms one must look at the forward problem: calculating the observables from a given set of parameters. In terms of localisation this refers to selecting a point in space, calculated the theoretical time delays, or bearing angles from hydrophone clusters, if the cetacean was vocalising at this point in space and then comparing the theoretical delays to the actual observed time delays or bearings. The more similar the theoretical and observed time delays the closer the point in space is to the actual position of the source position. By sampling many different locations the localisation algorithm can select that location which best fits the observed data. While this may sound highly inefficient, algorithms exist which can efficiently test multiple locations and converge on a solution sufficiently fast for real time operation on most modern computers.\n\n\nLeast Squares\nLeast squares methods are generally solving the inverse problem. Examples are found in hyperbolic localisation methods within the Group 3D localiser, where the least squares crossing point is calculated for multiple hyperbolae, each derived from a time difference of arrival on a pair of hydrophones. Another example is one of the target motion algorithms, which takes a set of bearings to an animal from multiple points along a track-line and finds the least squares solution to the crossing point of those bearings.\n\n\nSimplex, or Nelder-Mead\nSimplex, or Nelder-Mead methods are a commonly used way of solving the forward problem, i.e. guess an animal location and calculate theoretical values for the observed data (bearings, time delays, etc.), test the observed data against those values, move the animal a bit and see if updated theoretical values better fit the data, keep updating until the fit is as good as it can get. While this sounds computationally intensive, the Nelder-Mead method varies the step sizes as it tests different locations and is incredibly efficient at finding the optimal solution. Within PAMGuard these methods are used to cross bearings within the target motion algorithm, to cross bearings in the Group 3D localiser and also to estimate 2 and 3D locations direct from time delays using alternative algorithms within the Group 3D localiser\nMCMC\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a Bayesian statistical technique that has been applied to a large variety of problems, from estimating the solutions of complex integrals, to searching for exo-planets. The basic premise is to calculate a series of estimates which gradually increase in accuracy until a satisfactory solution is reached. The estimates form a chain of results which then bounces around the likely solution creating a probability distribution of results.\nIn terms of acoustic localisation MCMC is particularly useful due to its ability to easily incorporate experimental unknowns and then provide dynamic visualisations of the resulting errors. Utilising both real and simulated data this allows rigorous analysis of the effectiveness of a hydrophone array and easy quantification of the error for each individual localisation.\nFor acoustic localisation, parameter space generally refers to the Cartesian (or other) co- ordinates (x,y,z) but could also include other variables which would alter the theoretical time delays. These can include sound speed, salinity, hydrophone positions, and/or the angle of a vertical array.\nThe process begins with a random point in parameter space. From this initial point in space a random jump is executed. A jump involves changing each parameter value by a limited but random value. For example if the only parameters changing were the x.y,z co-ordinates then each jump would simply be a random jump through 3D space. Once a jump is executed a measurement of whether the new parameters are closer to the solution is undertaken. This is a chi squared value. The chi squared value compares the theoretical time delays calculated from the new jump location to the observed time delays. The lower the chi squared value the greater the similarity is between the theoretical and observed values. After jumping and calculating the new chi squared value the Markov chain then follows a series of three sequential rules. These are based on the difference between the previous and new chi squared values;\n1. If the new chi squared value is less than the previous chi squared value then the jump is accepted.\n2. If the new chi squared value is greater than the previous chi squared value then the jump is only accepted with a probability of;\n\n\n\nProbEq\n\n\nwere delta chi squared is the difference in chi squared between the previous and new jump point.\n3. If neither of the two above criteria is achieved the jump is not accepted and another random jump is executed from the previous point.\nThe result is a sequence or chain of jumps, which converge to form a cloud of points around the likely position of the acoustic source. The density of this cloud then represents the probability distribution of the acoustic source location in space. Figure 1. shows three MCMC chains converging to form a circular probability distribution. Here the acoustic source could be anywhere on a circle of possible locations, a common result when using linear arrays.\nFigure 1.\nAlthough this process requires large amounts of computational power the rapid progress of multi-core computing means it is possible to have multiple chains without a large increase in computational time.\n_References\nMagnus Wahlberg, Bertel M?hl and Peter Teglberg.

    "text": "Picture of the DIFAR Localisation Displays\n\n\nWhen DIFAR clips are processed from the DIFAR queue, they are sent to the DIFAR Localisation display where they are first demultiplexed in order to separate out the signals from the three acoustic sensors. Depending on the bandwidth and frequency resolution, demultiplexing may takes several seconds to perform on a typical 10 � 30s long clip, longer on slow computers. Progress is shown in the top right of the DIFAR Localisation display.\nThe Greeneridge demultiplexer has an inherent mechanism for determining whether a signal contains a correctly multiplexed DIFAR signal. Correct demodulation can only be achieved when the Greeneridge demultiplexer correctly locks onto the 7.5 and 15kHz carrier signals. The lock status is also shown in the progress bar, which will be red if the signal is not locked. If the signal doesn�t lock, then the clip should be discarded. NB: The AMMC demultiplexer does not presently contain any mechanism for determining whether a clip contains a correctly multiplexed DIFAR signal, thus when using the AMMC demultiplexer user experience and investigation of the directional signals may be required to determine whether the results of demodulation are sensible.\nThe display shows the spectrogram of the processed clip on the left with the DIFARGram on the right. By default, the spectrogram is created from the decimated raw input data (i.e. the omnidirectional hydrophone). Right clicking on the spectrogram allows the operator to display the signals from any of the three demultiplexed signals (i.e. omnidirectional, north-south, and east-west directional signals).\nThe DIFARGram is a colourmap of energy verses frequency and angle. There should be intense colour at the frequency of the selected sound and also at the angle from which the sound has arrived. To guide the eye a summary line is also displayed which shows the DIFARGram summed between the frequency limits of the clip. The summary line may be turned on and off by right clicking on the DIFARGram. The angle and frequency corresponding to the maximum energy are selected by default, and their values are shown as the Selection in the Info panel next to the DIFARGram.\nAt this time, the bearing calculated for the clip will be displayed on the PAMGuard map.\n\nButtons and Actions\nIf the operator is happy with the selected maximum, they can simply press the Save button. If The Auto button is selected, the clip will save automatically after a short delay. Alternately the operator can click anywhere on the DIFARGram to select a different angle and frequency (in which case the bearing displayed on the map will immediately update).\nDelete will permanently delete the clip. The clip can also be returned to the DIFAR queue by right clicking anywhere on the DIFARGram and selecting the appropriate menu item.\nThe Zoom Freq button causes both the spectrogram display and the DIFARGram to zoom in in frequency to slightly more than the frequency limits of the selected sound.\nPrevious: Managing the Queue\nNext: Advanced Localisation (Crossed Bearings and Tracked Groups)",

    "text": "The PAMGuard DIFAR Localisation module can be used to locate tonal sounds (e.g. calls from baleen whales) that have been acquired from DIFAR (directional) sonobuoys. The DIFAR Localisation module can be run in normal-mode for real-time localisation, or in mixed-mode for post-processing/re-analysis of existing DIFAR recordings, and the results from the DIFAR Localisation module can be displayed in viewer-mode.\n\nBackground\nOver the past two decades DIFAR (directional) sonobuoys have seen increased use in whale research programs worldwide.\nDIFAR sonobuoys contain a single omnidirectional pressure sensor, two directional particle-velocity sensors, and a magnetic compass. By comparing the amplitude and phase of signals on each of the three acoustic sensors it is possible to calculate the direction that a sound is coming from relative to magnetic north. Additionally, most DIFAR sonobuoys send data via VHF radio link back to an aircraft or nearby vessel. Consequently, the acoustic data from the three sensors are multiplexed (modulated) into a single signal prior to transmission. An important part of the processing is therefore the de-multiplexing (demodulation) of the signal back into the three separate acoustic components \u0007(Delagrange 1992)\b. While there are some general purpose tools available for working with DIFAR data such as the beamforming software from WhaleAcoustics, and the demultiplexing software by Greeneridge Sciences Inc real-time analysis of signals from DIFAR sonobuoys has remained the province of a limited number of bespoke (or restricted military) systems.\nThis module has been developed between SMRU and the Australian Marine Mammal Centre to serve as a flexible tool for for real-time localisation of loud & vocal species of baleen whales. The PAMGuard DIFAR Localisation module was made possible by the Southern Ocean Research Partnership. The module is BETA software, and further development of the module is still ongoing as of December 2014.

The Array Manager can be accessed via the Deploy button on the DIFAR Queue.\n\n\n\nDIFAR Array Manager\n\n\nPresently streamers for DIFAR sonobuoys should be configured using a “Fixed location” for the reference position, and a “Straight/Rigid Streamer”. An independent streamer is required for each sonobuoy when recording from multiple sonobuoy simultaneously (i.e. the number of streamers should be equal to the number of radio receivers used to receive signals from sonobuoys). The following image shows one of the streamers from a three-sonobuoy array.\n\n\n\nDIFAR Streamer\n\n\n\n\nDeploying\nThe Deploy button on the DIFAR Queue can be used when physically deploying a new sonobuoy. Clicking the Deploy button will open a menu allowing options to deploy a new buoy on any of the existing streamers that have been configured in the Array Manager. Upon selecting one of these menu items, a new Streamer Dialog window will appear.\nThe Streamer Dialog window will contain the GPS position of the ship at the time when the “Deploy channel” menu item was selected. If any of the streamers in the Array Manager have a numeric Streamer Name, then this will be used to automatically name the newly deployed streamer using the next sequential number. Thus, using the Deploy button is used to deploy all sonobuoys will result in sonobuoys names being sequential numbers.\nSonobuoys can be assigned alternative names, deployment numbers, or station numbers by typing directly into the Streamer Name.\nSonobuoy deployments will be stored in the PAMGuard database under the HydrophoneStreamers table.\nIn addition to a Deploy button, versions of PAMGuard after 1.15.05 also have an button titled Buoy Finished which will add a timestamp in the EndTime column of the database for the selected deployment. Aside from this timestamp in the database, the Buoy Finished button has no effect on the operation of PAMGuard’s DIFAR module, the Array Manager, or any other aspect of PAMGuard.\n\n\nSonobuoy Manager\nA ‘Sonobuoy Manager’ was added to the DIFAR module after PAMGuard version 1.15.05. The sonobuoy manager allows limited viewing and editing of sonobuoy metadata in normal, mixed, and viewer mode, and can be added to a User Display via the User Display menu. Presently, the DIFAR module only allows one Sonobuoy Manager window to exist.\nSonobuoys that have been edited via the Sonobuoy Manager will be updated both within PAMGuard modules (e.g. ArrayManager, Map, DIFAR Localisaiton Module, etc), and their corresponding entries in the PAMGuard database will be OVERWRITTEN. Thus users should exercise caution when using the Sonobuoy Manager and are encouraged to make backups of their database (NB: Sonobuoy metadata is stored in the HydrophoneStreamers table of the database).\n\n\n\nSonobuoy Manager\n\n\nPrevious: Configuring the DIFAR module\nNext: Configure DIFAR Displays",

These aren�t absolutely necessary for DIFAR processing, but it�s likely you�ll want them as part of your configuration.\n\nThe figure below shows a typical PAMGuard model for DIFAR processing\n\n\n\ndifarDataModel\n\n\nPrevious: Overview\nNext: Deploying Sonobuoys",

The Azigram displays directional information via a time-frequency-direction display. The display is similar to a spectrogram, but instead of colour representing power, it represents the angle of arrival with the maximum intensity at each time-frequency cell.\nSpecifically, this plugin implements the Azigram algorithm as described by Thode et al 2019 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. Vol 146(1) pp 95-102 (doi: 10.1121/1.5114810).\nThis module also includes the methods described in that paper for frequency domain demultiplexing of directional signals from DIFAR sonobuoys.",

    "text": "Configuring\nThe Azigram plugin presently has very few settings. The FFT length and FFT hop (and thus, the time and frequency resolution) for the Azigram display are determined by those used in the upstream FFT Module. The Source panel of the Azigram Settings allows for selection of the FFT module to use as input, and selection of specific channels from this upstream FFT module.\nThe sample rate of the Azigram output can be chosen from the Output panel of the settings. The plugin uses frequency domain downsampling in order to acheive the selected sample rate. When selecting the output sample rate, the output FFT length and FFT hop will be altered in order to maintain the same time and frequency resolution as the upstream FFT module.\n\nThe Azigram can be viewed on a Spectrogram Display. The HSV colour model is recommended for viewing Azigrams. This colour model is circular so will better illustrate the circular nature of the angular data (e.g. sounds from 359 degrees will be similar in colour to sounds from 1 degree). The limits of the Amplitude Range on the “Scales” tab of the “Spectrogram Parameters” should be manually set to Min 0 and Max 360. While this tab suggests that the Min and Max are in dB, the Azigram module will treat these values as degrees if an Azigram is being displayed.",

Select the menu item and a dialog box will appear with three tabs for selecting which displays send marked data to the grouper, which data from those displays are selected and finally, annotations which will be added to each Detection Group.\n\nSelecting Which displays\nThe Markers tab controls which displays send marks and data to the Detection Grouper\n\nSelect which displays you want to mark on. This may be all displays, or just some of them depending on the complexity of the PAMGuard configuration.\nDisplay markers can also be selected from the global Display Marks menu and dialog\n\n\nSelecting Which data\nSelect which types of data you wish to include when marks are sent to the Detection Grouper. Note that ANY type of data can be sent to the Detection Grouper, so consider carefully which types of data you are interested in.\n\n\nPartial Overlaps\nYou may want to select data that only partially overlap the mark you’ve made on the display. For instance, bearing lines on the map may cross at a clear point you want to mark, but extend beyond that point. Detections whos bearing lines cross the mark will only be included if the ‘partial’ check box is selected.\n\n\nData Selection\nSome types of data have additional selection options, for instance, types of identified clicks. If additional data selection options are available, then an additional symbol button  appears beside the name of each data. Click the button for data selection options and refer to the help pages for each data type for further information.\n\n\n\nAnnotations\nAnnotations are in important feature of the Detection Grouper. They allow the user to select which additional data are added to, or calculated from, the data in the selected marks\n\nA certain amount of common sense is required to select annotations compatible with the types of data you are planning to mark. For instance, if you are using the Target Motion annotation, then it will only be of use if the data you are marking have calculated bearings. Similarly, it may not be sensible to have more than one annotation that requires user input, for instance the text annotation AND the user forms annotation.\nFor more information on annotations, see Help With Annotations",

There will be an ambiguity across the plane (i.e. the source might be either side of it.\nVolumetric Arrays\nTwo unambiguous bearings, a horizontal angle and and elevation angle, are caclulated relative to the arrays coordinate frame.\nThe localiser is designed to work with “small” or “compact” arrays, which needs some definition. A small array is one in which the spacing of the hydrophones is less than half the length of the Fourier Transforms used in the localisation calculation. Although this can be varied in the configuration of the localiser, for clicks, it will typically be a bit longer than the longest click you’re likely to detect and for whistles, it’s likely to be 512 points for a typical configuration of the PAMGuard Whistle and Moan Detector for data sampled at 48kHz for a given Fourier Transform length, the maximum hydrophone separation is\nmax Separation = FTTLength / sampleRate * speedOfSound / 2\nThe table below shows some typical maximum hydrophone separations for common configurations\n\n\n\nSpecies\nSample Rate\nFFT Length\nMax Separation\n\n\n\n\nSperm Whale\n48 kHz\n1024\n16m\n\n\nPorpoise\n500 kHz\n512\n77cm\n\n\nDolphin Whistles\n48 kHz\n512\n8m\n\n\nBaleen Whale\n2 kHz\n256\n96m\n\n\n\nIn practice it is often better to keep hydrophone spacings to a lot less than this, for example, if clicks become too widely separated, then the Click Detector might separate them into separate detections. It is therefore generally wise to keep hydrophone separation small.\nThe bearing calculator can work with data from any detector in PAMGuard or with data marked manually on a spectrogram display.\nBoth Time Of Arrival and Beam Forming algorithms are available. Note that the Time of arrival algorithms are the same as those already built into the Click Detector so there is little point in running these a second time on Click Detector output.\nNext: Configuring the module",

Unlike the Beamformer module, the user cannot configure individual beams with the Bearing Calculator.\n\n\nConfiguring the Basic Frequency Domain and MVDR beamformers\nA beamogram can be used to sweep an entire area. The resultant output is a ‘heat-map’ of the amplitude of the signal versus primary angle, secondary angle or frequency. The output can be shown on a User Display tab by selecting New Bearing Calculator Display.\n\n\nArray Information: The type of array as defined by the channels in this group. Valid angle ranges are given in the appropriate sections below. There are three possible array types: Linear, Planar and Volumetric.\n\nLinear arrays position all the hydrophones in a single line (1-dimensional). This type of array has both left/right and up/down ambiguity. The primary angle is defined in the direction of the main array axis (Y-axis, as given in the Array Manager) and is valid from 0� (positive Y) to 180� (negative Y). The secondary angle is undefined.\nPlanar arrays position the hydrophones in two different axes (2-dimensional). This type of array resolves one of the ambiguities of the linear array, but not the other. For example, a planar array with both axis in the horizontal plane (X and Y) would be able to distinguish between left and right of the array, but not above or below. In that case the primary angle is defined relative to the main axis (positive Y) and valid from -180� to 180�. The secondary angle is measured perpendicular to the plane, and valid from 0� (in the same plane) to 90� (directly above/below).\nVolumetric arrays position the hydrophones in all three axes (3-dimensional). This type of array has no ambiguity. The primary angle is defined relative to the main axis (positive Y) and valid from -180� to 180�.

The first stage has to occur before FFT data are calculated in the FFT (Spectrogram) Engine. The remaining four stages can take place either in the FFT (Spectrogram) Engine module or in the Whistle and Moan detector.\nPerforming the noise removal in the FFT (Spectrogram) Engine module has the advantage that other PAMGuard processes and displays will have access to the data\nThe Whistle and Moan detector will try to ensure that the correct noise removal processes are run once and only once but looking back at the FFT data source and testing whether noise removal has already been done.\nNoise removal processes which have already been conducted in an earlier module cannot be repeated. However, the Whistle and Moan detector cannot check, and has no control over the configuration of noise removal processes conducted in earlier modules.\nGenerally, you should use the default settings\nClick Removal\nMedian Filter\nAverage Subtraction\nGaussian Kernel Smoothing\nThresholding\n\nClick Removal\nThis stage of the noise removal has to take place on the raw data prior to the calculation of the spectrogram. It is therefore carried out by the FFT (Spectrogram) Engine.\nThe click removal method operates on the time series data prior to the FFT calculation and therefore affects both output streams of the FFT Engine.\nClick removal measures the standard deviation of the time series data and then multiplies the signal by a factor which increases rapidly for large signal components. This has the effect of reducing the magnitude of short duration transient signals such as echolocation clicks\n\nOther noise removal stages can be controlled from either the Whistle and Moan detector dialog or from the FFT (Spectrogram) Engine\n\n\n\nMedian Filter\nWithin each spectrogram slice, the median value about each point is taken and subtracted from that point.\n\n\nAverage Subtraction\nA decaying average spectrogram is computed and subtracted from the current spectrogram value.\n\n\nGaussian Kernel Smoothing\nThe spectrogram is smoothed by convolving the image with a Gaussian smoothing kernel\n1 2 1\n2 4 2\n1 2 1.\n\n\nThresholding\nA threshold is applied and all data falling below that threshold set to 0.\nAlthough the Connected Region Search uses only a binary map of parts of the spectrogram which are above or below threshold it is generally more useful to output the input from the raw FFT data which will have been multiplied by the binary map.

However, these parameters give you the opportunity to limit the connected region search to a specific frequency band. This can be particularly useful if your data are contaminated by a lot of noise at a particular frequency.\n\n\nConnection Type\nWhen searching for connected regions, two main connection types are available.\nConnect 4 tries to connect each pixel to other pixels directly above, below, to the left or to the right (i.e. 4 possible connections).\nConnect 8 tries to connect to the sides and on the diagonals (i.e. 8 possible connections).\nClearly connect 8 will detect more whistles and can also detect whistles sweeping more rapidly, however connect 8 may also be prone to a higher rate of false alarm if it connects things which shouldn’t be connected.\n\n\nMinimum length and Minimum total size\nThere will always be a small number of random spectrogram pixels which are above threshold but are not part of a whistle or tone.

The spectrogram data are then compared to the noise level and areas of the spectrogram that exceed the background noise level by the detection threshold are selected. For each time partition of spectrogram data, ‘Peaks’ are then generated by looking for adjacent frequency bins that are over threshold. Peaks are only generated if the number of adjacent frequency bins exceeding the threshold is between two specified limits to avoid noise spikes( when very few adjacent bins above threshold) and broad band sounds (when many adjacent bins above threshold). In addition, if a large percentage of all the frequency bins in a time partition are above threshold, no peaks are generated. (Again this is indicative of broad band sounds such as clicks).\n\n\nLinking\nDetected peaks are then joined together. The joining process takes account of the frequency gradient, the rate of change of the frequency gradient and the rate of change of amplitude between peaks in successive time partitions and requires these to be values that are typical of odontocete whistles.\n\n\nWhistles\nOnce a time frequency contour is completed, it is classified as a whistle if it exceeds a minimum length. (In fact these are usually fractions of whistles.)\nFuture releases of PAMGuard will contain more sophisticated classification systems to determine species.\n\n\nWhistle Event\nA Whistle Event occurs when the rate at which whistles are produces exceeds a specified minimum value. Since there is generally a low rate of false detection of individual whistles, and since encounters with most whistling species result in a high rate of whistle detection, whistle events are often a more useful indicator of the presence of animals than individual whistles.\n\n\nWhistle Localisation\nIf whistles are being detected on two or more pairs of hydrophones, then should whistles be detected simultaneously on multiple pairs (overlapping in time and frequency) the bearings from each hydrophone pair are automatically crossed to produce a location for the whistle source (subject to left-right ambiguity).\nNext: Creating a new whistle detector",

    "text": "These instructions guide a user on how to configure the “3-D” module in PAMGuard for estimating range and depth of a source using a long-aperture towed array. At the time of this writing the module has only been tested with synthetic WAV files and not real-time input, and only with a Static and Threading Hydrophone Locator.\n\nPreliminaries\nAt a minimum the 3D Towed Array module requires an upstream Data acquisition module and a Click Detection module (labeled Sound in and Click Detector in Figure 1). At present the 3D module is configured to only work with the Click Detector, and not any Ishmael detectors. A typical array configuration is illustrated in the following figure, which appears under the Hydrophone display. At present only two pairs of hydrophones (4 phones total) are used in the module.\n\n\n\nHydrophone Array Configuration\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminaries\n\n\nThis figure shows the configuration menu for the Audio Data Acquisition module (SoundIn in Figure 1) which should be configured to select a synthetic wav file. The wav file has 4 channels, with the hydrophone closest to the tow vessel being assigned the lowest channel number.\nThe Click Detection module has many options, but only the following menu needs to be changed from the default, as shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\nPreliminaries\n\n\nThe “Source” tab arrangement shown here assigns the first two channels to Group 0 (thus generating a forward subarray bearing) and the last two channels to Group 1, (generating the rear subarray bearing).\n\n\n3-D Towed Array Settings\nThe module assumes that the separation between the two pairs of hydrophones in the array is great enough that an ambiguity may exist as to how to match a particular detection on the rear subarray with candidate detections on the forward subarray. This ambiguity is more likely when multiple acoustically active animals are present. In general, the module also assumes that the array elements are deep enough that surface-reflected paths from pulsive sounds can be cleanly separated in time from the direct paths. The time delay between a direct and surface-reflected path will be defined as an “echo time” for the rest of this discussion. The echo time of a detection, along with the acoustic bearing of the detection, provide a set of features that permit identification of the signal between subarrays.\nTo match the appropriate signals the program builds a queue of detections for each subarray, and assigns an inter-click interval (ICI) to each detected click. The ICI of a new detection is computed by searching the queue for a detection that shares a similar bearing and “echo time” to the present detection. One the ICI is assigned, the program can build a “linked ICI” list that provides the ICI of the N previous detections that share similar features to the current detection. This ICI list can then be compared to lists on the forward array to locate the corresponding detection on the forward array.\n\n\n\n3-D Towed Array Settings\n\n\nThis figure shows the settings menu for the 3-D Towed Array module. The Detector source should be set to ‘Clicks’, and all four channels selected. The selection parameters are as follows:.\nMinimum ICI needed: This parameter N defines the number of ICI to incorporate into a list for cross-array comparison. In general the larger the number the less likely a mistake will be made in assigning detections between forward and rear subarrays.\nMaximum multipath time: Surface-reflected multipath is flagged by the fact it must arrive only a short time after a direct path. This number sets the maximum “echo time” that will be assigned by the system. Generally, this should be set to twice the hydrophone depth divided by the sound speed.\nMaximum Queue Time: Sets the amount of time a particular detection will be retained by the subarray queue, to be available for ICI matching.\nICI estimation: percent angle error: The percent difference between the bearing of a new detection and a candidate detection must be less than this number, in order to use the candidate detection to assign an ICI to the new detection.\nICI estimation: echo time error: Same as above, except the error percentage is computed for the echo time. If an echo time is present, then the bearing and echo time are weighted equally in the decision to link two detections together. If no echo time is present, then only the bearing error is used.\nUse cross-correction to refine TOA: The echo times and relative arrival times between subarrays are computed form the detection times provided by a Detection Data Unit. To achieve more precision the raw data between detections can be cross-correlated to increase the precision of the estimate of the relative arrival time. At present only the direct-surface TOA (echo time) feature is enabled.\nGenerate 3D positions: If not checked, no 2-D or 3-D positions are computed. This is a debug feature to permit the user to set up all other modules before attempting to localize.\n\n\nTracking methods\nA pull-down menu permits the user to select five different tracking combinations.\nCross bearings: The simplest tracking algorithm simply uses the ICI analysis to generate bearings from the forward and rear subarray, and thus estimate slant range. This slant range is plotted as a horizontal range on the map.\nTOA only, simple TOA estimate: If echo times are available on both subarrays, then a track can be computed without having to rely on acoustic bearings. This “TOA only” method is advantageous for situations where the sources are directly ahead or behind the tow vessel, and where the array cable inclination is not measured and cannot be estimated accurately. The “simple TOA estimate” simply means that a detection on the rear subarray is matched to a detection on the forward subarray by simply selecting the detections that have the smallest relative arrival times with respect to each other. For a single animal the “simple TOA estimate” should work more quickly than a full ICI analysis.\nTOA and rear bearing, simple TOA estimate: Same as previous, except that the rear subarray bearing, instead of the forward subarray echo time, is used to compute position. Best used for sources off the beam of the vessel and situations where the echo time is not available on the forward subarray. Typical situations where this happens include noise masking from noisy vessels, and shallow hydrophones on the forward subarray.\nTOA only: estimate TOA using ICI Same as TOA only option previously discussed, except that ICI patterns are used to match detections on the subarrays. Should be used when multiple animals are present.\nTOA and rear bearing, estimate TOA using ICI: Same as TOA and rear bearing option discussed above, except that that ICI patterns are used to match detections on the subarrays. Should be used when multiple animals are present.\n\n\n\nTracking methods\n\n\nAny 3-D tracking method (TOA option in the Tracking method pull-down menu) will generate a Map image similar to that shown in this figure. The depth of the source is indicated by the size of the circle and by text printed next to the circle.The “Cross bearing” output is demonstrated in the following figure.\n\n\n\nTracking methods\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking methods\n\n\nThis figure shows Spectrogram and radar plot of simulated 3-D sources on PAMGuard.\n\n\n\nTracking methods\n\n\nThis figure simulated 3D tracking data for multiple animals as it appears in Click Detector view.",

Tyler A. Helble, Glenn R. Ierley, Gerald L. D’Spain, and Marie A. Roch and John A. Hildebrand. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 131, 2682 (2012).\nhttp://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.3685790\n\nAlgorithm\nFor details of the algorithm, see Helble et al 2012. The papers abstract is given here to give a quick summary of what happens. In many ways, the algorithm is similar to an in band energy detector, however by raising the amplitude of the data in a spectrogram to a higher power, tonal sounds become amplified by a much greater amount than broader band sources of noise such as shipping or wave motion.\n\nABSTRACT (from Helble et al, 2012)\nConventional detection of humpback vocalizations is often based on frequency summation of band-limited spectrograms under the assumption that energy (square of the Fourier amplitude) is the appropriate metric. Power-law detectors allow for a higher power of the Fourier amplitude, appropriate when the signal occupies a limited but unknown subset of these frequencies. Shipping noise is non-stationary and colored and problematic for many marine mammal detection algorithms. Modifications to the standard power-law form are introduced to minimize the effects of this noise. These same modifications also allow for a fixed detection threshold, applicable to broadly varying ocean acoustic environments. The detection algorithm is general enough to detect all types of humpback vocalizations. Tests presented in this paper show this algorithm matches human detection performance with an acceptably small probability of false alarms (PFA &lt; 6%) for even the noisiest environments. The detector outperforms energy detection techniques, providing a probability of detection PD = 95% for PFA &lt; 5% for three acoustic deployments, compared to PFA &gt; 40% for two energy-based techniques. The generalized power-law detector also can be used for basic parameter estimation and can be adapted for other types of transient sounds.\nNext: Configuring the GPL Detector",

    "text": "When a toothed whale, bat or other echolocator uses echolocation for hunting or sensing their surroundings they usually produce regular clicks/calls which vary slowly in inter-click/call-interval, amplitude, bearing etc. Individual click detections can be difficult to classify from other random transients because recieved waveforms and spectra are distorted by number of factors, such as narrow beam profiles, frequency dependent absorption, propogation effects and animal behaviour. The broadband clicks of many dolphins psecies are especially difficult to distinguish because they are very similar to many other sources of transient noise, such as cavitations from ship propellors. However, the echolocation clicks used by toothed whales (and bats) are not produced in isolation - animals tend to rapidly produce clicks with a slowly varying inter-click-interval (ICI); there are very few non-biological sources which produce regular repetitive sound and so this provides an additional contextual dimension for click classification. An automated algorithm which is based on identifying repeating patterns of sounds therefore has the potential to be significantly more accurate than an algorithm based on identifying individual calls.\nThe PAMGuard click train detector module is used to detect and then classify repeating patterns of clicks. It is designed to work with multiple types of acoustic data, from CPOD detections to single channel and multi-channel hydrophone recordings.",

    "title": "Overview",
    "section": "How it works",
    "text": "How it works\nPAMGuard’s click train detector utilises both a detection and classification stage to extract click trains from recordings.\nThe detection stage is currently based on a multi hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm. This algorithm considers all possible combinations of transient detections creating a large hypothesis matrix which holds potential click trains. As more clicks are added to the hypothesis matrix it grows exponentially and so, to prevent a computer running out memory, it is regularly “pruned” to keep only the most likely click trains over time. The assigned likelihood of a click train is based on number of properties which can be defined in by the user. For example, a user might select, ICI, Amplitude and Correlation as variables to score click trains; this would mean that combinations of clicks with slowly changing ICI, amplitude and waveforms would be favoured by the algorithm and stay in the hypothesis matrix. Other properties such as bearing, click length and peak frequency can also be selected. A graphical explanation of the click train detection algorithm is shown in Figure 1 and a more detailed explanation of the be found in Macaulay (2019).\n\nDiagram demonstrating how the click train algorithm works. Black dots are a set of 14 detected clicks at times t1 to t14. The click train algorithm begins at click 1 and creates two possible clicks trains, one that includes the first click (filled circle) and the other in which the click is not part of the click train (non-filled circle). The algorithm then moves to the next click and adds it to the hypothesis matrix. As the number of clicks increases, the hypothesis matrix exponentially expands in size and must be pruned. After a minimum of Npmin clicks (in this case 4) each track hypothesis (possible click train) is assigned a ?2 score. The track hypothesis with lowest score (defined by larger coloured circles) has it’s branch traced back Np (in this case 3) clicks. Any track hypothesis which do not include the click Np steps back are pruned (defined by the double lines). Clicks which share no click associations with the first track hypothesis are then pruned and the process repeats until all clicks are part of a track or a maximum number of tracks have been considered (in this example there are two tracks). The algorithm then moves to the next click, adds it to the hypothesis matrix, assigns ?2 scores and traces the lowest ?2 branch Np steps back, pruning the hypothesis matrix again; the process repeats until the last click. Note that there is always a track hypothesis with no associated clicks (i.e. the bottom-most branch where no clicks belong to a click train). If a track hypothesis is confirmed and thus removed from the hypothesis matrix, then this track can be used to start another click train\nThe advantage of this MHT approach is that the click train detection module is quite general and can cope with a large variety of complex situations and multiple overlapping click trains. The disadvantage is that there are a large number of potential variables which can be set that affect the performance of the detector which can make it complex to initially set up.\nThe subsequent classification stage attempts to classify detected click trains to species. Classification is currently based on a series of relatively simple binary classification steps but there is scope for machine learning approaches in future versions. The binary classification is based on parameters such as number of detected clicks, the mean and standard deviation in ICI and bearing and the correlation of the average spectrum of the click train with a predefined spectral template.\nA click train which has been both detected and classified is saved to PAMGuard’s database and can be reclassified in PAMGuard’s viewer mode.",

    "section": "Configuring the click train detector",
    "text": "Configuring the click train detector\nThe primary settings to configure can be split into MHT Kernel and ?^2 settings - these are all set in the primary click train detector dialog as shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe settings pane of the click train detector.\n\nMHT Kernel Settings\nThe MHT Kernel is the part of the detection algorithm which creates and then prunes the large hypothesis matrix which keeps a copy of all possible click trains. MHT Kernel settings are therefore important because they influence speed (a larger number of possible click trains in memory is more processor intensive) and the quality of the detections (the larger the number of possibilities the more likely that “true” click trains are contained in the hypothesis matrix). The specific settings are;\nPrune-back: The hypothesis matrix needs pruned so that it does not grow exponentially and cause memory issues. The matrix is pruned at Np (see Figure 1) previous detections i.e. if Np is 5 then then then the algorithm selects the most likely click train, moves back five detections back and discards other hypothesis that do not contain the combination of clicks in that branch. Thus, increasing the prune-back means that more hypothesis are kept at any one time but decreasing will lead to faster processing times as less combination are kept in memory.\nPrune-start: The initial number of detections before the pruning process starts. This cannot be less than Prune-back and should generally should be set no more than 15 for 8GB of memory.\nMax no. coasts: A click train is saved and removed the hypothesis mix once it has passed a number of tests. It must be over three clicks long, survive the pruning process and have missed the max no. coasts. A coast is when a click has been missed from a click train based on ICI. i.e. if the ICI is 2s and a click train goes for 6s without a detected click then there have been 3 coasts. Increasing the maximum number of coasts means that click trains are less fragmented but can come at the cost of keeping click trains in the hypothesis matrix for longer which have ended.\nMax no. trains: This is a maximum allowed number of trains in the hypothesis mix. Note this refers to the number of trains which can survive pruning - the actual number of potential click trains in the hypothesis mix will be much larger. Generally, just via pruning, the hypothesis matrix will keep itself below the max no. trains, however, in certain situations it can grow too large and requires a limit. The max no. trains therefore usually have little effect on results but should generally be set to less than 50 to ensure smooth processing\n\n\n?2 Settings\n?2 is a measure of the likelihood that a click train is from a (usually) biological source. The higher the ?2 value the lower the quality of a click train.\nThe ?2 model used in the click train detector considers both the slowly varying properties of click trains, as well as bonus and penalty factors to discourage fragmentation and aliasing (selecting a multiple of the true ICI) of detected click trains.\nThe initial basis of the model is:\n\nwhere m is the number of selected descriptors, e.g. ICI, amplitude, bearing etc., and y(i,k) is the measurement of descriptor i for click k in a click train with n associated clicks. t(k+1) is the measured time of a click k. Each descriptor is divided by qi which is a user tuneable parameter that alters the importance each descriptor has on the total ?2. Ideally it should correspond to a prediction of the likely variance of the descriptor.\nThe descriptors can be enabled and the variance set in the ?2 Settings pane. The toggle button next to each descriptor sets whether a descriptor is used to score a click train and the variance is then set using the slider or by inputting manually by clicking the settings cog. Increasing the variance means that the descriptor has less of an influence on the calculation of ?2 and decreasing means that the descriptor has a larger influence on ?2. In some cases, clicks can be so close together that the variance is tiny and thus ?2 becomes huge e.g. during buzzes. A minimum variance value (qti) prevents the variance (max(qi (t(k+1)-tk ),qti )2) from falling below very low values.\nIdeally the variance for each parameter would be calculated from a test dataset of manually annotated click trains e.g. by calculating the variance of ICI of all marked click trains.\n\nEach descriptor has a variance setting which can be changed by moving the slider or manually inputting data by clicking the settings button. Variance is multiplied by the ICI for each click detection because clicks closer together in time the descriptor values will change less. In some cases, clicks can be so close together that the variance is tiny and thus ?2 in Eq. 1 becomes huge e.g. during buzzes. A Min. Error prevents the variance from falling below very low values.\nThe available descriptors parameters can be set in the click detector settings pane (Figure 3) and works as follows;\nIDI: the inter-detection-interval in milliseconds. The algorithm looks for slowly changes in the interval between detections.\nAmplitude: the amplitude in dB re 1/muPa pp. The algorithm looks for slowly changing amplitude values. Note that the algorithm is comparing the change in change in amplitude so that the click train algorithm is not biased against large but consistent changes in amplitude (e.g. due to a narrow beam profile sweeping across a hydrophone).\nBearing: the bearing of multi-channel clicks in degrees. Slowly changing bearings will increase the likelihood that click trains are detected. Note that in a similar way to Amplitude, the change in change in bearing is considered so that the algorithm is not biased against large but consistent changes in bearings. The bearing parameter has some additional settings which apply a large penalty to clicks trains if there is a large (user-defined) jump in bearing.\nCorrelation: the algorithm calculates the peak of the cross-correlation value of subsequent clicks and looks for slowly changing values in the cross-correlation value. This tells the click train algorithm to search for clicks with consistent/slowly changing spectra. The correlation descriptor also has some additional settings which allow the user to pre-filter waveforms before cross-correlation. This is especially useful in removing noise from higher frequency detections.\nTime Delays: the time delay between multi-channel clicks in milliseconds. The algorithm looks for slowly changing values in the time delays between multichannel clicks. This is useful for arrays with more than two hydrophones where an error in a single time delay measurement may cause a substantial error in bearing. Like amplitude and bearing, the time delay values are the change in change in time delays between subsequent clicks to ensure that click trains are not biased against faster changes in bearing.\nClick Length: the length of the saved waveform of a click in milliseconds. This is a crude measure of the length of a click; however, it can be useful in helping the algorithm distinguish between species with long multi-modal clicks such as sperm whales, and much shorter broadband clicks such as dolphins.\nPeak Frequency: the peak frequency in Hz. The peak frequency between subsequent clicks is used score click trains. This is useful for click trains with very stable peak frequencies such as echosounders, narrow band high frequency species and perhaps some beaked whale species.\n\n\nAdvanced ?2 Settings\nThe descriptors used in Eq. 1 on their own do not provide a good score for click train detections. This is because Eq.1 can achieve the same score by either skipping clicks e.g. every second click in a click train, or by splitting click trains into smaller fragments.\n\nThe advanced settings for calculating ?^2. These parameters are primarily used to prevent click train aliasing and fragmentation. The advanced settings (see Figure 4) are a series of additional factors that prevent aliasing and fragmentation and work as flows.\nLow ICI Bonus: if the median ICI of the possible click train is above a specified maximum value, a large penalty is added which effectively makes it one of the least likely click trains in the hypothesis matrix. If the median ICI is below the maximum value then ?2 = (?2 (I/(maxk_Ik))LI where I is the median ICI, maxk_ Ik is the maximum ICI in the possible click train and LI is the low ICI Bonus constant term. This bonus term favours lower ICI values, preventing aliased click trains.\nLong track bonus: add a bonus factor for longer click trains to prevent fragmentation. This is the total length of the click train in seconds divided by the total hypothesis matrix time in seconds L which is then multiplied so that ?2 = (?2*L)LT where LT is the long track bonus.\nCoast penalty: add a penalty for “coasting” i.e. when an expected click, based on ICI, is not present in the click train. This penalty is multiplied by the number of coasts i.e. the likely number of missed clicks based on ICI\nNew Track Penalty: if a track hypothesis is newly added in the hypothesis matrix, then add a minor penalty factor. This is added until the number of click trains exceeds No. New Track Clicks",

Currently, only target motion is supported.\nLocalisation is enabled by ticking Localise click trains. The type of localisation algorithm which is used is selected in the Localisation algorithms (See the localisation section in PAMGuard help for more info on localisation algorithms). Localisation using 3D simplex and MCMC can be processor intensive, especially when there are a large number of clicks in a train and so the Algorithm Limits pane can be used to set a maximum number of input clicks for a localisation. If the maximum is exceeded then clicks are sub sampled from the click train evenly in time.\nGenerally, target motion localisation only works well when there are a large number of clicks over a long time period. The Filters tab allows users to select which click trains are localised and also to remove spurious results from unsuccessful localisations.

    "text": "Target Motion Analysis\nA common method for tracking animals, particularly sperm whales, is to use Target Motion Analysis or TMA. TMA works by measuring bearings to a sound source from multiple locations along a track-line. The crossing points of the bearings indicates the location of the tracked sound source.\nThere are two ways of linking clicks together to form click trains when using PAMGuard in �normal� mode, i.e. analysing data in real time. On the click detector bearing time display, clicks assigned to a train are shown in colour, depending on the options selected from the displays settings menu.\n\nManual Click Train Identification\nThe most effective method of click train identification is for the operator to manually select clicks from the click detector bearing time display which they believe come from the same animal. To track clicks manually, right click anywhere on the bearing time display, scrolling will then pause and you can then release the mouse over the click you wish to mark. A small popup menu will appear with a single option to create a New Click Train\n\n\n\nmarking first click\n\n\nWait a while until the angle to that click train has changed and mark another one in the same way. This time, the menu will have the options of adding the click to the existing click train, or creating a new click train.\n\n\n\nmarking click\n\n\nIf you ware tracking multiple animals, then start a New Click Train.\n\n\nAutomatic Click Train Identification\nPAMGuard can attempt to mark Click Trains automatically. To enable automatic click train identification go to Click Detection &gt; Click Train Identification\n\n\n\nclick train ID options\n\n\nClicks are associated if there is a regular Inter Click Interval (ICI) and the clicks are on a slowly and steadily changing bearing. In the control section set the minimum number of clicks for a train to be created, the minimum angle for Target Motion Analysis (TMA) to be run and in the minimum interval between location and database updates. This last parameter is important since the localisation calculations can take 100�s of milliseconds, so repeating them every time a click is added to a click train can cause PAMGuard to run too slowly.\nICI changes controls the minimum and maximum allowable ICI and the change ratio governs how much the ICI can change for a new click to be added to an existing click train. For example, if the currently measured ICI is 1.0s and the change ratio is 1.2, then the ICI to the next click can be anything between 1/1.2 = 0.83s and 1.2s.\nAngle changes is the maximum angular deviation allowed for the next click. As a click train is starting, this is the angle difference between clicks. Once a train has enough clicks for a localisation, it�s the angle off from that localisation point.\n\n\nCorrecting Mistakes\nIf you make a mistake tracking manually or if you think the automatic train identification has made a mistake, click on the click that�s been assigned incorrectly and a slightly different menu appears giving four options.\n\n\n\ncorrecting a marked click\n\n\n\nRemove the click from the train (the click will then not be assigned to anything)\nReassign ALL clicks in that train to a different train\nReassign that click as a new click train.\nSelect the train the click should be assigned to (if other clicks have been started)\n\nIt is very common for the automatic click train identification algorithm to break up an obvious click train into many smaller ones. This happened when there are pauses or changes in click rate. Reassigning all clicks in a train is a handy way of correcting these errors in order to generate long click trains which will yield accurate localisations.\n\n\n\nDatabase Output\nClick train information is written to the PAMGuard database using the same database tables used for offline data analysis. This means that any event marking which took place in real time will be available for further offline analysis. Two database tables are used: The �events table� contains one record of information per click train, the second �clicks table� contains a record for each click in each event. To maintain compatibility with earlier versions, the two database tables are called Click_Detector_OfflineEvents and Click_Detector_OfflineClicks (the name Click_Detector_ in these table names will change to whatever the name of the click detector created in the PAMGuard configuration you are using and if you have multiple click detectors, multiple tables with different names will be created.)\nPrevious: Advanced Click Classification\nNext: Click Storage Options",

    "text": "Click Detector Displays\nThe click detector display contains four main sub windows, although it is possible to have more than one instance of the main bearing / time display if desired. Two optional displays, IDI Histogram and Wigner Plot, are also available by selecting Click Display&gt;Add Display in the toolbar menu.\n\n\n\ntoolbar display selection\n\n\nRight clicking on the bearing / time display brings up a pop-up menu from which you can configure the display.\n\n\nBearing Time Display\n\n\n\nRCDisplayWithSperm (29K)\n\n\nEach detected click is shown as a circle or ellipse on the scrolling display. The display options, available by right clicking on the display, can be used to select the parameter to display on the vertical axis: bearing, amplitude or inter-click-interval. Note that inter-click intervals will only be shown in the automatic click train identifier is running.\nThe example shows 20s of data with three sperm whales currently slightly ahead of the hydrophone array.\nThe duration of the display may be adjusted using the right hand (vertical) slide bar.\nThe horizontal slide bar is disabled during data acquisition.\n\n\nManual tracking\nClick trains identified by eye may be tracked manually.\nTo track manually, press the default mouse button anywhere on the display. While the mouse is held down, the display will stop scrolling allowing you to position the mouse above a particular click. Release the mouse over a click and that click will be ‘tracked’.\nTracked clicks may be overlaid on the map display and also on radar type displays.\n\nManual tracking with least squares localisation\nIf the same operation is performed using the right mouse button, then a pop-up menu appears and the operator is asked to assign clicks to numbered groups. Clicks within the same tracking group are assumed to be from the same source. PAMGuard then uses a least squares fit to estimate the position of the source based on the most likely crossing point of the bearing lines for each tracked group.\nIf a location has been successfully calculated, it can be displayed on the map and radar displays.\n\n\n\nAutomatic Tracking\nIf the automatic click train identifier is running, clicks will be coloured when they are assigned to a click train. As with manual tracking, PAMGuard will use a least squares fit to estimate the position of the source based on the most likely crossing point of the bearing lines.\nAs with manual tracking, automatic click trains are displayed on the map, either as bering lines (when no position has been calculated) or as a bearing line and point if a position has been calculated.\n\n\nClick Waveform Display\nThe waveform of each click is displayed as it is detected.\n\n\nClick Spectrum\nThe power spectrum of each click is displayed as it is detected.\n\n\nTrigger\nThe trigger window shows the amplitude of the signal on each channel as a decaying histogram. The vertical red line represents the trigger threshold set in the detection parameters dialog (cross reference).\nLevel meters for each channel are also shown on the right hand side of the trigger window.\n\n\nDisplay Options\nDisplay options for windows on the tab panel are accessed from the Click Display&gt;Display Settings menu or by right clicking on the display.\n\n\n\nClickDisplayParameters1 (9K)\n\n\nThe axis panel (shown above) shows the same basic three options for the vertical axis that can be selected from the pop-up menu. It also allows you to select limits for the vertical axis when ICI or Amplitude are displayed. The number of horizontal grid lines may also be set (note that this is stored separately for the three types of vertical axis).\n\n\n\nClickDisplayParameters2 (9K)\n\n\nThe size at which each click is displayed can also be set. Clicks sizes will scale between the lower and upper bounds based on their amplitude and duration.\n\n\n\nClickDisplayParameters3 (9K)\n\n\nIf the click classifier is running it is possible to select which types of clicks get displayed.\n\n\nIDI Histogram\n\n\n\nInter-Detection Interval Histogram Display\n\n\nThe IDI (Inter-Detection Interval) Histogram Display provides a visual interpretation of the inter-detection interval on two different scales. The display uses a horizontal split-pane to present the data in both a high-resolution (left pane) and low-resolution (right pane) format. The relative proportion of the panes can be changed by dragging the center divider to the right or to the left.\nThe vertical axis is the elapsed time since the acoustic data collection was started, and is common to the two panes. The units are minutes. Each row in a pane represents a histogram of data accumulated over the course of a certain time period (the time bin), as defined by the IDI Display parameters (see below). In the image above, the time bin is 1 second. This means a histogram is generated every second from the IDI data that has been compiled over the last second, and displayed on the screen.\nEach pane has it’s own horizontal axis. Each column represents a range of IDI values, where the size of the range is defined by the IDI Display parameters (see below). In the image above, the IDI bin size is 1 ms for the high-resolution pane and 5 ms for the low-resolution pane. The highest value bin is 70 ms for the high-resolution pane and 700 ms for the low-resolution pane. Taking the low-resolution pane as an example, the first bin would count the number of inter-dection invertvals that fall between 1 ms and 5 ms, the second bin would count the number of inter-dection intervals that fall between 6 ms and 10 ms, etc.\nEach row/column combination, therefore, is a cell that represents the number of inter-detection intervals counted in a specific IDI range over a specific time period. The color of each cell represents the magnitude of that count, with black indicating 0 and red indicating a maximum value as defined by the IDI Display parameters (see below). In the image above, the maximum counts in the high-resolution pane is 20 and the maximum counts in the low-resolution pane is 50.\nWhen a click is detected, the inter-detection interval is calculated as the elapsed time since the previous click detection (in milliseconds). The IDI bin with a range spanning that data point is determined, and the count within that bin is incremented by one. When the time bin has elapsed, the counts in each IDI bin are converted to a color and displayed on the screen as a new row at the bottom of the pane. Each previous row is moved up by 1 to make room. The row at the top of the pane is discarded.\nWhen repositioning/tiling the window or resizing the split panes, the display may on occasion not update properly. In such a circumstance, simply adjust the size of the window slightly in order to force a redraw.\n\n\nIDI Display Parameters Dialog\n\n\n\nIDI Display Parameters Dialog\n\n\nThe IDI-Display Parameters Dialog can be accessed by right-clicking on the display window and selecting Plot Options. 3 parameters can be specified for both the high-resolution and low-resolution histograms:\n\nBin Scale: the size of each bin in the horizontal scale, in milliseconds\nMax Value: the value of the highest bin in the scale, in milliseconds. In the above image for the low-resolution histogram, a bin size of 5 ms and a maximum value of 700 ms means there are (700/5=) 140 bins with ranges 1-5ms, 6-10ms, 11-15ms … 691-695ms, 696-700ms.\nMax Counts: the highest number of counts in a bin, corresponding to the color red\n\nThe two time parameters are:\n\nBin Scale: the size of each time bin over which the histogram data is compiled, in seconds\nMax Value: the maximum amount of time shown on the chart, in minutes. In the above image, 1 minute of data with 1 second bins means a maximum of 60 histograms displayed at a time.\n\nThe histogram data can also be captured in a csv file, the name and location of which is specifed by the user. The first column in each row is the time of the click detection. Each column thereafter contains the counts found in a histogram bin - first the bins in the high-resolution histogram, followed by the bins in the low-resolution histogram. The values in the header row represent the upper limit of the bins (ie. for bin 1-5ms the header displays a 5, for bin 6-10ms the header displays a 10, etc).\nThe user should use caution when saving data, as the process is processor-intensive and will slow down other program functions.\nPrevious: Click Detector Displays\nNext: Click Detector Side Panel",

    "text": "The click detector is used to detect transient signals, primarily from odontocete species such as sperm whales, beaked whales and harbour porpoises.\n\nCreating an instance of the click detector\nFrom the File&gt;Add modules&gt;Detectors menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display, select ‘Click Detector’. Enter a descriptive name for the new detector (e.g. sperm whale detector, beaked whale detector, etc) and press Ok.\n\n\nConfigure the Data Source\nGo to Click Detection&gt;Detection Parameters to configure the click detector.\n\n\n\nData Source\n\n\nThe click detector requires a source of raw data before it can operate. This may come directly from a Sound Acquisition module (e.g. a sound card or a National Instruments board) or from processed data such as the output from a Decimator or Filter.\nSelect an appropriate input source from the drop down list on the click detector Detection Parameters menu,\n\nChannel Grouping\nUse the channel grouping controls to arrange the data channels into groups.\nChannels in the same group are analysed together so that if one channel in a group is triggered, all channels in that group are read-out together to create a detected click.\nThe click detector works best if data are analysed in pairs of channels. It can then use the time delay within each pair to calculate a bearing. If multiple pairs of hydrophones are used, these bearings can be crossed to estimate source locations.\n(Click detector output .clk files can also be further analysed with RainbowClick software if the channels are arranged in pairs).\nIf you only have a pair of hydrophones, then select either ‘One group’ or ‘User groups’ and set the group numbers to be the same.\nIf you have multiple pairs of hydrophones, select ‘User groups’ and arrange the group numbers so that each group contains two channels as shown above.\nIf you select ‘no grouping’ each channel will be analysed totally independently. There are currently no PAMGuard functions which can re-group these single channel clicks for source localisation.\n\n\n\nData flow and advanced configuration\nThe data flow through the click detector is shown below\n\n\n\nDataFlow (3K)\n\n\nThe filters and trigger decision parameters can all be adjusted by the user to be optimal for a particular species; and for the background noise conditions from a particular vessel and operating area. Setting many of these parameters is an expert procedure and requires both experience and a thorough understanding of the types of sound being detected.\n\n\nFilters\nYou will see in the figure above that two filters are used; a digital prefilter and a digital trigger filter. Two filters are required for the following reason. For optimal detection efficiency, the trigger only receives data in the frequency band in which the animal is making sound. However, classifiers that assign clicks to a particular species will require data from more parts of the spectrum. For instance, when detecting harbour porpoises which produce narrow band clicks between 100 and 150kHz, the trigger filter is set to a band pass filter covering only that frequency range. The pre-filter however is set to a high pass filter at 20kHz. The clip data therefore contains data in the spectrum between 20kHz and 250kHz, which is used by the classifier to distinguish between narrow band porpoise clicks and broad band clicks from other sources.\nBoth filters can be configured. Go to Click Detection&gt;Digital pre Filter… or Digital trigger filter… respectively. Both filters configured using the Filter Design panel.\n\n\nTrigger decision\nThe trigger automatically makes a measure of background noise and then compares the signal level to the noise level. When the signal level reaches a certain threshold above the noise level a click clip is started. When the signal level falls to below the threshold for more than a set number of bins, the click clip ends and the clip is sent to the localisation and classification modules.\nTrigger parameters are set in the Triggers tab of the Click Detection&gt;Detection Parameters menu:\n\n\n\nDetectionParameters-trigger (9K)\n\n\nIndividual channels can be ‘turned off’ in the trigger by un-checking the appropriate check boxes. Note however, that if a deactivated channel is part of a group, that channel will still be read if another channel in that group triggers. This feature can be used to reduce false triggers if one channel develops a noise problem.\n\nThe maths behind it all\nThe noise level N at sample i is measured using\n\n\n\nnoiseLevelEquation (1K)\n\n\nand the signal level S is measured using\n\n\n\nsignalLevelEquation (2K)\n\n\nwhere ?N is either the long filter parameter when no click is active (i.e. the signal is below threshold) or the Long Filter 2 parameter when the signal is above threshold. ?S is the Short filter parameter. A click is started / stopped when the ratio S/N goes above / below the Threshold parameter.\n\n\nClick Length\n\n\n\nDetectionParameters-length (9K)\n\n\nThe click only ends when all chosen channels have been below threshold for the number of samples specified by “Min Click Separation” .\nThe maximum length of a click is set such that click clips are limited to a maximum number of samples.\nWhen a clip is created, a number of extra samples are added to the clip before the first and last samples to rise above threshold and after the last sample to be above threshold (pre sample and post sample in the dialog).\n\n\nDelays\nTEXT\n\n\n\ndetection_parameters_delays\n\n\n\n\n\nFFT_filtersettings\n\n\n\n\nEchoes\nTEXT\n\n\n\ndetection_parameters_echoes\n\n\n\n\nNoise\nTEXT\n\n\n\ndetection_parameters_noise\n\n\nNext: Click Detector Displays",

If possible, organise your sound files so that you have one file folder per species and all the species folders are sub folders of a master training data folder as shown below.\n\nOrganising your data in this way is not essential, but it does mean that processing of all files can take place as a single operation (e.g. over the weekend)\n\nSound Acquisition\nSet up your Sound Acquisition module to analyse data from file folders, set the file folder to be the root directory containing your folders of files by species and check the option to include sub folders. Do not check the option to merge contiguous files so that processing stops and starts at the end of each file.\n\n\n\nSpecies Names\nIf your data have been organised into folders as described above, the classifier can use the folder names as species names.\nIf your data are not organised in the way described above, then you will need to enter the species name for the training set you are working on (which should of course now be just of a single species).\n\n\nStorage Folder\nTraining data are stored in files with the ending .wctd (Whistle Classifier Training Data). One wctd file will be created for each sound file analysed. Use the Browse button to select the folder you want these files to be stored in.\n\n\nRunning\nRun PAMGuard. All the files in the directory structure of training data will be processed and .wctd files created in your output folder. The main classifier display will show distributions of whistle fragment parameter but will not be performing classification.\nThere are of course other ways of organising your training data. For instance, if you wish to add new data to an already existing training set, it is not necessary to reprocess all the data.\nOnce you have created your .wctd files, you will need to run the Discriminant Function Training before you can use the classifier on new data\nPrevious: Configuring the Whistle Classifier\nNext: Discriminant Function Training",

    "text": "Once a whistle has been selected in the main spectrogram window, a new window opens containing the portion of the spectrogram selected by the user. The user must click on the starting point of the whistle, and then the ending point (note that these can be reselected later). Once the starting and ending points have been defined, ROCCA will extract and display the whistle contour (shown in yellow).\n\n\nWindow Title: displays the current detection tally. ROCCA keeps track of how many whistles have been selected in the current PAMGuard session and displays this information in the window title.\nZoom In/Out/Reset: changes the zoom level of the spectrogram.\nIncrease/Decrease Brightness: modifies the brightness of the spectrogram. Note that this only modifies the spectrogram display. The underlying contour extraction algorithm is not affected.\nIncrease/Decrease Contrast: modifies the contrast of the spectrogram. Note that this only modifies the spectrogram display. The underlying contour extraction algorithm is not affected.\nNoise Sensitivity spinner: modifies the noise sensitivity parameter used for contour extraction. This parameter controls the width of the frequency band that is used when searching for the peak frequency in the next time slice (see �Adjusting noise sensitivity�). The contour is automatically recalculated when this value is changed, and the spectrogram display is updated. Note that any contour points moved manually will not be changed when the noise sensitivity parameter is changed. Note also that the noise sensitivity parameter does not change the global noise sensitivity parameter as specified in the Rocca Parameters window, only the noise sensitivity used in this spectrogram popup window.\nSpectrogram window: the current spectrogram.\nSelect Contour Start/Contour End: allows user to reselect the starting or ending point of the whistle. Upon selection, the contour will recalculated automatically.\nTurn Contour Off: toggle the contour display on and off.\nPick Points: when clicked, erases existing contour trace and enters ‘Selection’ Mode. In selection mode the user can manually select points along the contour by clicking on the spectrogram itself. The user can select any number of points, but only one frequency per time bin is allowed. If multiple frequencies are selected within a time bin, only the first is kept and the rest are ignored. The user can also hold the mouse button down and drag the mouse along the contour to quickly select multiple points. When the Pick Points button is pressed a second time, Selection Mode ends. ROCCA will fill in any missing time bins using linear interpolation, and then proceed to calculate the contour variables.\nHighpass/Lowpass/Reset filters: limits the contour extraction algorithmso that it functions only within a specific frequency band. Specify a filter by either typing in the desired frequency and hitting , or hitting the  button and clicking on the desired frequency in the spectrogram. The frequency filter is drawn as a horizontal red line on the spectrogram. The contour is automatically recalculated when these values are modified, and the spectrogram display is updated. Reset the filters by clicking the  button. Note that any contour points manually moved will not be changed. Note also that the spectrogram display is not affected by the filters, only the contour extraction.\nUndo Last Move: return the last contour point that was moved manually to its previous location.\nRecalc Contour: recalculate the contour after manually moving one or more contour points to new positions.\nReset Contour: unlock all contour points that have been manually moved.\nClassify/Reclassify: classify the currently-extracted contour, or reclassify the contour after changes have been made. The classification is displayed to the left of the button.\nSave as encounter […]: save the whistle clip wav file, contour points, and measured contour variables to the directory specified in the Rocca Parameters window using the encounter number that was active when the whistle was captured in the spectrogram. The encounter number is shown on the button for reference. The spectrogram popup window is then closed and the focus returns to the main PAMGuard display. Classification results will be added to the Rocca Sidebar.\nSave as diff encounter: save the whistle clip wav file, contour points, and measured contour variables to the directory specified in the Rocca Parameters window, but first query the user as to which encounter number to use. The spectrogram popup window is then closed and the focus returns to the main PAMGuard display. Classification results will be added to the Rocca Sidebar.\nSave WAV only: save the whistle clip wav file to the directory specified in the Rocca Parameters window using the current encounter number (shown in the window title bar). This option is useful if the user wishes to classify the whistle later.\nDiscard and Exit: discard the current whistle, close the spectrogram popup window and return to the main PAMGuard display without saving anything.\nTime/Frequency: displays the current time and frequency location of the cursor.\n\nPrevious: Selecting a Whistle\nNext: Contour Extraction / Manipulation",

    "text": "The ROCCA (Real-time Odontocete Call Classification Algorithm) module is intended to provide a set of measured variables for detected acoustic events. The variables differ depending on whether the acoustic detection is a delphinid whistle or click. ROCCA uses these parameters in conjunction with a user-selected random forest classification model to classify the whistle or click to species. Three random forest models are available; one for odontocete species in the northwest Atlantic, one for species in the temperate Pacific and one for species in the waters surrounding Hawaii.\nIndividual whistle/click detections and classifications are grouped into user-defined Encounter Numbers. An encounter is defined as a set of whistles and/or clicks that can all be attributed to one school of odontocetes. Variables describing the acoustic behavior of the encounter are measured from the whistle and click detections for that encounter. Each encounter is classified based on information from detected whistles, clicks and ancillary variables using the encounter classifier, or as the species with the highest number of random forest tree votes if no event classifier has been selected.\n\nDelphinid Whistles\nROCCA classifies delphinid whistles based on spectrographic measurements extracted from whistle contours. The contour extraction algorithm measures 50 different variables for each contour. Whistles can be classified based on measurements taken manually or based on measurements taken automatically. Manual classifiers are available for species in the tropical Pacific Ocean (TropPacWhist.model) and for species in the northwest Atlantic (NWAtlWhist.model). Automated whistle classifiers are available for species in the northwest Atlantic (NWAtlWhist_auto.model), the temperate Pacific (TempPacWhist_auto.model) and the waters surrounding Hawaii (HIWhist_auto.model).\nThe manual classifier requires seven main steps:\n\nUser selects a whistle from the spectrogram display by drawing a box around it using the cursor\nThe whistle is captured by ROCCA and displayed in a new spectrogram window window\nThe whistle contour is traced either automatically by ROCCA or manually using the cursor. The user can manipulate the trace, if desired\nThe time-frequency points are automatically extracted from the contour\nThe contour parameters are automatically measured\nThe contour is classified using the currently-loaded classifier model\nThe classified whistle statistics are added to the specified Encounter in the GUI display and the saved data files\n\nROCCA can also be used in conjunction with the Whistle & Moan Detector module to measure and classify whistles detected and extracted automatically.\n\n\nOdontocete Clicks\nROCCA measures 17 variables from clicks passed to it by the Click Detector module. Each click is classified to species based on these variables and the currently loaded classifier model, and the click statistics are added to the specified Encounter in the GUI display and the saved data files.\nClassifiers are available for species in the tropical Pacific Ocean (TropPacClick.model), the northwest Atlantic (NWAtlClick.model), the temperate Pacific (TempPacClick.model) and the waters surrounding Hawaii (HIClick.model).\n\n\nEncounters\nROCCA measures 17 variables from the whistles and clicks classified within each encounter. The encounter is classified to species based on these variables and the currently loaded classifier model, and the results are passed to the GUI display and the saved data files. Note that if no encounter classifier has been specified, the encounter will be classified based on the species in the encounter with the highest cumulative percentage of random forest tree votes.\nClassifiers are available for encounters in the tropical Pacific Ocean (TropPacEnc.model), the northwest Atlantic (NWAtlEnc.model), the temperate Pacific (TempPacEnc.model) and the waters surrounding Hawaii (HIEnc.model).\n\nReferences\nOswald, J.

    "text": "Creating a ROCCA module\nFrom the File &gt; Add Modules &gt; Detectors menu, select “ROCCA”. Enter a descriptive name for the new module and press OK.\nROCCA requires an FFT engine module to operate. If no FFT engine module has been loaded, PAMGuard will warn the user and automatically load one.\nWhen the ROCCA module is created, it will automatically try to load a classifier model. ROCCA will also check to see if an Enounter Stats file exists. If it does, the user is given the option to load the contents of the file into memory.\nNote: the Encounter Stats file is continually overwritten while ROCCA is running. If, upon startup, the user does not load the data into memory, the information in the file will be lost. Thus if the user does not wish to load the data but still desires to keep it, the file should be renamed before continuing with PAMGuard.\n\n\nConfiguring a ROCCA module\nNote: the Sound Acquisition and FFT Engine modules must be configured before configuring ROCCA.\nFrom the Detection menu, select “ROCCA Parameters”. A new dialog should appear containing five tabs: Source Data, Contours/Classifier, Output, Filename Template, and Notes.\n\n\n\nSource Data tab\n\n\nData Source: where ROCCA should get it’s input data from. Options include an FFT module (select this if using the manual classifier), a Click Detector, and a Whistle and Moan Detector. Multiple sources can be selected. The whistle and moan detector and/or click detector should be selected if using the automated classifier.\nFFT Data source: the fft data source to be used. The channels listed are those currently selected in the FFT Parameters dialog. ROCCA will save a wav file clip of each manually selected whistle contour whenever it is classified and added to the current encounter. Check the channel boxes corresponding to the channels you wish to save to this clip wav file. Note that this is different than the channels displayed in the spectrogram window, which are set in the display options dialog. Whistles can be selected and contours extracted from any channel displayed, but the saved whistle clips will only contain data from the channels selected in the FFT data source box. So it is possible (though not recommended) to extract and classify a whistle from Channel 0, but only save the data from Channels 1 and 2.\nClick Detector source: the Click Detector to be used. Both the click source and the noise source must be specified, along with the appropriate channels. There are two options for the click source: Clicks and Tracked Clicks. Selecting Clicks sends all auto-detected clicks to the ROCCA module. Selecting Tracked Clicks sends only those clicks which are assigned to click trains (see Click Train Identification and Click Detector displays for more details) to ROCCA. The ‘Select Click Types’ button allows the user to select which types of clicks (as classified by the Click Detector module based on user-supplied settings) to send from the Click Detector to ROCCA for analysis.\nNoise Data Samples should be selected for the Click Detector Noise Source. These noise data samples are automatically collected by the Click Detector module at intervals which can be set by the user in the Click Detector Settings dialog window. The noise samples are used to calculate the RMSNOISE and SNR click variables\nNote: a Click Detector Module must first be configured and at least one Click Classifier defined, for appropriate options to be displayed in the Click Detector Data Source frame. See the PAMGuard help files for full details on creating and configuring the Click Detector module.\nWhistle and Moan source: the Whistle & Moan Detector to be used. This drop-down box will list all currently configured Whistle & Moan Detector modules. After performing its own analysis, the Whistle & Moan Detector will send all detected whistles to the ROCCA module. ROCCA will then measure contour variables, classify the whistles, add the results to the sidebar and save the results to output files, but no popup Spectrogram window will appear.\nNote: a Whistle & Moan Detector Module must first be added and configured for appropriate options to be displayed in the Whistle & Moan Data Source frame. See the PAMGuard help files for full details on creating and configuring the Whistle & Moan Detector module.\nGPS Source: the source for GPS signals. Some encounter classifiers use latitude and longitude as classification variables.\n\n\n\nContour/Classifier tab\n\n\nWhistle Classifier: select the classifier to be used for whistles. The available classifier models were created based on the Weka Random Forest model. A classifier model uses the file extension .model. To select a classifier model, click the Select Whistle Classifier button. To not classify whistles at all, click the Clear Whistle Classifier button. At the moment the ability to create new classifiers within PAMGuard is not available.\nClick Classifier: select the classifier to be used for clicks. The available classifier models were created based on the Weka Random Forest model. A classifier model uses the file extension .model. To select a classifier model, click the Select Click Classifier button. To not classify clicks at all, click the Clear Click Classifier button. At the moment the ability to create new classifiers within PAMGuard is not available.\nEncounter Classifier: select the classifier to be used for acoustic encounters. Classifier models are created based on the Weka Random Forest model. A classifier model uses the file extension .model. To select a classifier model, click the Select Encounter Classifier button. To not classify encounters at all, click the Clear Encounter Classifier button. At the moment the ability to create new classifiers within PAMGuard is not available.\nWhistle/Click Threshold: the threshold value to use when classifying individual whistles or clicks. If the percent of trees voting for the predicted species in the random forest falls below this threshold, the whistle or click is considered non-classifiable and is labelled as �ambiguous�.\nEncounter Threshold: the threshold value to use when classifying encounters. If the percent of trees voting for the predicted species in the random forest falls below this threshold, the encounter is considered non-classifiable and is labelled as �ambiguous�.\nThe whistle/click threshold can be used in one of two ways: as an absolute value, or as the minimum difference between the highest vote and the second-highest vote. If used as an absolute, whistles will only be classified if the percent of trees in the random forest voting for the predicted species is higher than the selected threshold. If used as a difference, whistles will only be classified if the highest percentage of trees in the random forest voting for the predicted species is greater than the second-highest percentage by the threshold value.\nNoise Sensitivity: specify the global noise sensitivity parameter to use when extracting a whistle contour.\nEnergy Bin Calc Size: specify the size of the frequency bin used to calculate the energy around each peak frequency.\nCalculate Whistle Encounter Stats:select whether or not to calculate ancillary variables for the detected whistles, for use by the Encounter Classifier. Calculations may cause memory issues when there are many (&gt;1000) whistles.\nCalculate Click School Stats:select whether or not to calculate ancillary variables for the detected clicks, for use by the Encounter Classifier. Calculations may cause memory issues when there are many (&gt;1000) clicks.\n\nNote that the Whistle, Click and Encounter classifiers selected by the user should all have been trained with the same species list in order to be compatible with each other.\nNote also that if either whistle or click encounter stats are not calculated, the encounter classification will be based on whistle or click classification results only. The number of trees that voted for each species will be tallied over all whistles and clicks in the encounter and the encounter will be classified as the species with the highest number of random forest tree votes. Even if an encounter classifier has been loaded, it will be ignored.\n\n\nOutput tab\n\n\nOutput Directory: specify which directory clip wav files, whistle contour points and whistle contour variable measurements are saved to. Note that, with Microsoft Windows operating systems, it is a good idea to select a directory that does not require administrator privileges to save to.\nContour Stats Save File: specify the name of the file that classified whistle contour variables are saved to. The file will be saved to the output directory, specified above. Each classified whistle is appended to the end of the file when one of the Save buttons in the Spectrogram Popup window is clicked.\nEncounter Stats Save File: specify the name of the file that encounter classifications are saved to. The file will be saved to the output directory, specified above. Note that in order to use the latest encounter numbers, this file is overwritten during each save. While this is not a problem as long as PAMGuard is run continuously, if this file exists when PAMGuard is first loaded the contents will be lost. If the file exists during start up, the user is warned and given a chance to load/rename/backup the existing file.\n\n\n\nFilename Template tab\n\nIn addition to the Contour Stats and Encounter Stats save files, ROCCA also saves a whistle clip (wav format) and a list of the contour points (time and frequency, csv format). These files will be named according to the template given in the text box on this tab. As part of the name, the user is able to use any of the following symbols. When the files are saved, ROCCA will substitute the actual values for the symbol names.\n\n\n\nSymbol\nMeaning\n\nSymbol\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nf\nname of source\n\nH\nhour, 24-hour clock\n\n\nn\ndetection number\n\nh\nhour, 12-hour clock\n\n\nX\ndetection tally/count\n\na\nam or pm\n\n\nt\nchannel/track number\n\nm\nminute\n\n\nY\nyear, 4 digits\n\ns\nsecond\n\n\ny\nyear, 2 digits\n\nS\nsecond of the day, 5 digits\n\n\nM\nmonth\n\nd\ntenths of a second\n\n\nD\nday of the month\n\nc\nhundredths of a second\n\n\nJ\nday of the year, 3 digits\n\ni\nthousandths of a second\n\n\n\nNote that all date/time values are GMT.\n\n\nNotes tab\n\nThis tab provides the user an opportunity to save additional information about the data. Any number of text boxes can be used. The information contained in the text boxes will be saved on every row of the Contour Parameters file. In addition, a text file containing standard notes can be loaded. The contents of the text file will then be available in a drop-down list for each text box. The format of the text file is one note per line.\nNote: commas cannot be used in the text boxes or the standard notes text file.\n\n\nROCCA Mark Observers\nROCCA must be added to the Mark Observers list in the spectrogram in order to receive captured data. To do so, right click on the spectrogram and select Settings. Select the Mark Observers tab and check the box beside ROCCA. If ROCCA is not listed as a possible mark observer, it has not been added as a module.\nPrevious: ROCCA Overview\nNext: Selecting a Whistle",

    "text": "Output from the deep learning module can be viewed in PAMGuard viewer mode, or extracted from binary files using MATLAB or R.\n\nPAMGuard viewer mode\nDetections form continuous raw data are shown in the datagram in the same way as all data streams in PAMGuard.\nThe Time base display FX is best way to view detailed data outputs from the deep learning algorithm. The time base display can display almost all data types in PAMGuard on a large variety of different data axis. For example, click detections can be displayed on an amplitude, bearing, ICI, waveform and/or frequency axis. Deep learning detections (i.e. data units which have been saved from raw data using the deep learning detector) can be displayed on the time base display in the same way as many other detections and in addition, there is a symbol manager options which allows the deep learning detections or other detections which have been classified by the deep learning module to be coloured by prediction class. This means that a manual analyst can quickly navigate to detections with high prediction values for a certain class. Hovering over or right clicking on a data unit in the time display and selecting the information button, will show the data unit’s metadata, including the prediction values for all output classes from the deep learning model.\n\nAn example click detection module output coloured by deep learning annotations. Click detections are annotated with the results from the deep learning module. The symbol manager in the time base display can be used to colour the clicks by the prediction for a selected class\nOther displays also show outputs from the deep learning module. Hovering over data units in the click display will, for example, show deep learning prediction values. The spectrogram will also show deep learning detections as translucent blue boxes (these must be selected in the right click menu).\n\n\nMATLAB\nThe easiest way to export to MATLAB is to select the desired units in the time base display, right click and select the MATLAB icon. Data units will be exported to a .mat file as list of structures which is then saved to the clipboard. This file can be saved and then dragged into MATLAB to open.\nWhere it is necessary to further analyse large datasets produced by PAMGuard, there is a MATLAB-PAMGuard library which can directly import the binary files which store PAMGaurd detection data. The library is simple to use with the primary function being loadPAMGuardBinaryFile.m. This will load any binary file type (e.g. clicks, whistles, deep learning detections) and return a list of data structures with the detection data. The structures include annotations where deep learning predictions are stored.\nHere is a simple example loading up all the deep learning detections for a right whale classifier.\n% the folder containing PAMGuard binary files\nfolder = '/Users/me/right_whale_project_1/PAMBinary/'; \n%load all the detections in the folder\ndldetections = loadPamguardBinaryFolder(folder, 'Deep_Learning_Classifier_Raw_Deep_Learning_Classifier_DL_detection_*.pgdf')\nThe predictions for each class (in this case the classes are noise and right whale) are easily accessed in the structure via;\n%% access the prediction form the first detection \npredicitons = dldetections(1).annotations.dlclassification(j).predictions;\nThe loaded detections can then be plotted by accessing the waveform data in each structure;\n% plot all the spectrograms.\nclf\ntiledlayout(5,5)\nfor i=1:length(dldetections)\n   \n   nexttile\n   \n   % generate the data for a spectrgram\n   [s, w, t] = spectrogram(dldetections(i).wave,512, 384,[],sR,'yaxis');\n   \n   % create the time and frequency matrices required to plot a surface \n   [X, Y] = meshgrid(t,w);\n   % plot the surface (divide and multiply by 1000 to show milliseconds and kHz respectively)\n   surf(X*1000, Y/1000, 20*log10(abs(s))-140, 'EdgeColor', 'None')\n   view([0,90])\n\n   caxis([70, 140]-140)  \n   ylim([0,0.5]); \n   xlabel('')\n   ylabel('')\n   \n   if (mod(i,5)==0)\n      c = colorbar;  \n      c.Label.String = 'Amplitude (dB)'; \n   end\n\n   %x axis only on bottom plots\n   if (i&gt;=20)\n      xlabel('Time (ms)') \n   end\n   \n   %y axis only on left most plots\n   if (mod(i-1,5)==0)\n      ylabel('Frequency (kHz)') \n   end\nend\n\nRight whale detections from a deep learning model imported and then plotted in MATLAB\n\n\nR\nIn the same way as MATLAB export, the PAMGuard time base display and export selected data units directly to an R struct which can be imported easily into R..\nR also has a well supported PAMGuard library with like for like functions compared to the MATLAB library.

    "text": "Module settings\nThe module settings are opened by selecting the Settings &gt; Raw deep learning classifier menu. The main settings pane is shown below and is split into three sections, Raw Sound Data, Segmentation and Deep Learning Model\n\nThe main settings pane for the deep learning module with descriptions\n\nRaw Sound Data\nThe deep learning module accepts any raw data source i.e., any data source that contains raw waveform data e.g. clicks, clips and Ishmael detections. Note that the module accepts whislte and moan detections but only if a delphinID classifier has been loaded.\nIf the data is continuous, e.g. from the Sound Acquisition module then deep learning detections are saved to PAMGuard’s data management system if they pass a user defined prediction threshold. The raw waveform data for segments which pass prediction threshold is saved and the detection is annotated with the deep prediction results.\nIf the data source is an existing detection data stream, e.g. clicks or clips, then the deep learning results are saved as an annotation attached each detection. The data is segmented in exactly the same way as continuous data and thus, depending on the length of raw data within the detection, there can be more than one prediction per detection.\nChannel grouping controls are used to arrange channels into groups. Channels in the same group are saved together for downstream processes. So, for example if channels 0 and 2 are in a group, then the raw waveform data from both channel 0 and 2 will be saved and can be used in downstream processes, e.g., for localisation.\n\n\nSegmentation\nThe segmentation section defines how the raw data is segmented. Some deep learning models require a specific segment size and others can be run with different segment sizes. The Window Length is the size of the segment in samples. The Hop Length is the overlap (from the start of the segment) in samples. A Hop Length which is the same as the segment length means no overlap. If a prediction passes threshold, then the raw data from segments is saved to PAMGuard binary files. If concurrent segments pass a prediction threshold, then they are saved as one data unit. The Max. re-merge is the maximum number of segments that can form a single data unit before a new data unit is automatically created.\n\n\nDeep Learning Model\nThe deep learning model section is used to select the deep learning model. The drop down menu is used to select the framework the model is from e.g. Generic model. Note that each model type has a unique user interface which appears just below the drop down menu - currently these all look fairly similar.\nAll frameworks require a model file to be selected using the browse button (File icon). A wait icon will appear and the model will be loaded. If the deep learning model loading is successful then the filename of the model will appear (e.g. saved_model.pb)\nNote: when a model is first loaded, the computer must be connected to the internet as PAMGuard will download the correct libraries for the computer to open the specific model. On Windows machine these libraries are found in a hidden folder called ai.djl. in the user account folder.\nOnce the model has loaded there some unique options depending on the currently selected framework.\n\nGeneric Model\nA generic model must be set up via the Advanced menu button.\n\nBefore a sound segment can be classified it must be converted into a format suitable for the deep learning model. This is achieved by a list of transforms which convert a raw sound data into an appropriate format. Usually this involves converting to a spectrogram image and then performing a series of noise reductions and interpolation step. For the generic model users either have to manually add transforms and input the correct settings for each, or load a transforms *.pgtr setting file\nThe Model Transforms tab in the advanced menu pane allows a user to set up a set of transforms. The Add transfrom + button adds a transforms and these can be dragged in order using the drag handles on the left of each transform. Each transform has it’s own settings pane which can be expanded to show transform specific settings. The bottom of the advanced settings pane shows a preview of the data that will be input into the deep learning model, including the shape of the input data e.g. a 100x50 image.\n\nThe Model Settings tab allows the model inputs and outputs to be defined\nThe Model Settings tab allows the model input shape and output shape/classes to be defined.

    "section": "Module settings",
    "text": "Module settings\nThe module settings are opened by selecting the Settings &gt; Raw deep learning classifier menu. The main settings pane is shown below and is split into three sections, Raw Sound Data, Segmentation and Deep Learning Model\n\nThe main settings pane for the deep learning module with descriptions\n\nRaw Sound Data\nThe deep learning module accepts any raw data source i.e., any data source that contains raw waveform data.\nIf the data is continuous, e.g. from the Sound Acquisition module then deep learning detections are saved to PAMGuard’s data management system if they pass a user defined prediction threshold. The raw waveform data for segments which pass prediction threshold is saved and the detection is annotated with the deep prediction results.\nIf the data source is an existing detection data stream, e.g. clicks or clips, then the deep learning results are saved as an annotation attached each detection. The data is segmented in exactly the same way as continuous data and thus, depending on the length of raw data within the detection, there can be more than one prediction per detection.\nChannel grouping controls are used to arrange channels into groups. Channels in the same group are saved together for downstream processes. So, for example if channels 0 and 2 are in a group, then the raw waveform data from both channel 0 and 2 will be saved and can be used in downstream processes, e.g., for localisation.\n\n\nSegmentation\nThe segmentation section defines how the raw data is segmented. Some deep learning models require a specific segment size and others can be run with different segment sizes. The Window Length is the size of the segment in samples. The Hop Length is the overlap (from the start of the segment) in samples. A Hop Length which is the same as the segment length means no overlap. If a prediction passes threshold, then the raw data from segments is saved to PAMGuard binary files. If concurrent segments pass a prediction threshold, then they are saved as one data unit. The Max. re-merge is the maximum number of segments that can form a single data unit before a new data unit is automatically created.\n\n\nDeep Learning Model\nThe deep learning model section is used to select the deep learning model. The drop down menu is used to select the framework the model is from e.g. Generic model. Note that each model type has a unique user interface which appears just below the drop down menu - currently these all look fairly similar.\nAll frameworks require a model file to be selected using the browse button (File icon). A wait icon will appear and the model will be loaded. If the deep learning model loading is successful then the filename of the model will appear (e.g. saved_model.pb)\nNote: when a model is first loaded, the computer must be connected to the internet as PAMGuard will download the correct libraries for the computer to open the specific model. On Windows machine these libraries are found in a hidden folder called ai.djl. in the user account folder.\nOnce the model has loaded there some unique options depending on the currently selected framework.\n\nGeneric Model\nA generic model must be set up via the Advanced menu button.\n\nBefore a sound segment can be classified it must be converted into a format suitable for the deep learning model. This is achieved by a list of transforms which convert a raw sound data into an appropriate format. Usually this involves converting to a spectrogram image and then performing a series of noise reductions and interpolation step. For the generic model users either have to manually add transforms and input the correct settings for each, or load a transforms *.pgtr setting file\nThe Model Transforms tab in the advanced menu pane allows a user to set up a set of transforms. The Add transfrom + button adds a transforms and these can be dragged in order using the drag handles on the left of each transform. Each transform has it’s own settings pane which can be expanded to show transform specific settings. The bottom of the advanced settings pane shows a preview of the data that will be input into the deep learning model, including the shape of the input data e.g. a 100x50 image.\n\nThe Model Settings tab allows the model inputs and outputs to be defined\nThe Model Settings tab allows the model input shape and output shape/classes to be defined. Most models will have metadata on the input and output data and these can be set by selecting the Use default model shape and Use default model out switches respectively. Otherwise, the input and output shape and the output classes must be defined manually\nThe import and export buttons on the bottom of the advanced settings pane can be used to export and import settings for the generic model. This means that users do not have to manually set up transforms and input and output data whenever settings up a new PAMGuard data model and allow easier sharing of classifiers amongst researchers.\n\n\nAnimalSpot and Ketos models\nIf using an AnimalSpot or Ketos model then all transforms are automatically set up. The transforms can be viewed and altered via the Advanced menu button but in the majority of cases these settings should not be used. It is advisable to select “Use default segment length” to change the Window length to the default for the selected model. Note that this is often necessary for Ketos models but usually not a requirement for AnimalSpot models.\n\nAn AnimalSpot or Ketos model will automatically create a list of transforms with the appropriate settings. These is no need to use the advanced pane but it is there in case users wish to change transform settings for some reason"

    "text": "Viewing and exporting results\nOutput from the deep learning module can be viewed in PAMGuard viewer mode, or extracted from binary files using MATLAB or R.\n\nPAMGuard viewer mode\nDetections form continuous raw data are shown in the datagram in the same way as all data streams in PAMGuard.\nThe Time base display FX is best way to view detailed data outputs from the deep learning algorithm. The time base display can display almost all data types in PAMGuard on a large variety of different data axis. For example, click detections can be displayed on an amplitude, bearing, ICI, waveform and/or frequency axis. Deep learning detections (i.e. data units which have been saved from raw data using the deep learning detector) can be displayed on the time base display in the same way as many other detections and in addition, there is a symbol manager options which allows the deep learning detections or other detections which have been classified by the deep learning module to be coloured by prediction class. This means that a manual analyst can quickly navigate to detections with high prediction values for a certain class. Hovering over or right clicking on a data unit in the time display and selecting the information button, will show the data unit�s metadata, including the prediction values for all output classes from the deep learning model.\n\nAn example click detection module output coloured by deep learning annotations. Click detections are annotated with the results from the deep learning module. The symbol manager in the time base display can be used to colour the clicks by the prediction for a selected class\nOther displays also show outputs from the deep learning module. Hovering over data units in the click display will, for example, show deep learning prediction values. The spectrogram will also show deep learning detections as translucent blue boxes (these must be selected in the right click menu).\n\n\nMATLAB\nThe easiest way to export to MATLAB is to select the desired units in the time base display, right click and select the MATLAB icon. Data units will be exported to a .mat file as list of structures which is then saved to the clipboard. This file can be saved and then dragged into MATLAB to open.\nWhere it is necessary to further analyse large datasets produced by PAMGuard, there is a MATLAB-PAMGuard library which can directly import the binary files which store PAMGaurd detection data. The library is simple to use with the primary function being loadPAMGuardBinaryFile.m. This will load any binary file type (e.g. clicks, whistles, deep learning detections) and return a list of data structures with the detection data. The structures include annotations where deep learning predictions are stored.\nHere is a simple example loading up all the deep learning detections for a right whale classifier.\n```matlab% the folder containing PAMGuard binary files folder = ‘/Users/me/right_whale_project_1/PAMBinary/’;\n%load all the detections in the folder dldetections = loadPAMGuardBinaryFolder(folder, ’Deep_Learning_Classifier_Raw_Deep_Learning_Classifier_DL_detection_*.pgdf’)\n\nThe predicitons for each class (in this case the classes are noise and right whale) are easily accessed in the structure via;\n\n ```matlab\n            &lt;span class=\"hljs-comment\"&gt;%% access the prediciton form the first detection &lt;/span&gt;\npredicitons = dldetections(&lt;span class=\"hljs-number\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;).annotations.dlclassification(&lt;span\n                class=\"hljs-built_in\"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;).predictions;\nThe loaded detections can then be plotted by accessing the waveform data in each structure;\n&lt;span class=\"hljs-comment\"&gt;% plot all the spectrograms.&lt;/span&gt;\nclf\ntiledlayout(&lt;span class=\"hljs-number\"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=\"hljs-number\"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;)\n&lt;span class=\"hljs-keyword\"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;

    "section": "Configuring the matched click classifier",
    "text": "Configuring the matched click classifier\nThe matched click classifier settings are accessed via Settings-&gt; Matched click classifier_. The settings are split into the three sections, general settings, click waveform and click templates.\n\nThe settings pane of the matched click classifier\n\nGeneral Settings\nThe general settings allow for channel options, species ID and the default colours for classified clicks to be to be set. _ Channel Options _allows users to define whether a single click from one channel, all clicks or an averaged click should be used to be used for classification in multi-channel situations. if there is only one channel then this makes no difference.\nClick Type sets the number that defines the species ID. Make sure this is not the same as any of the species IDs in the default click classifier (this is why the default is set so high).\nSymbol and Fill define the default colours clicks which have been classified by the matched click classifier should be plotted on displays.\n\n\nClick Waveform Settings\nBefore a click is classified it undergoes some pre-conditioning by the matched click classifier.\nRestrict parameter extraction to XX samples sets the maximum length of the waveform to the classifier. If this is selected, then center of the click is located and samples trimmed around the center. In some use cases, for example SoundTrap detections, which may be 10,000 samples long, setting a lower number of maximum samples can greatly increase processing speed and improve the accuracy of results. Note that if the number of samples is set too low (e.g. well below the click template length) then the correaltion values will not make much sense.\nPeak threshold and Smoothing are both parameters used to find the click center so that a click can be trimmed to the maximum number of samples. The click length is measured by calculating the waveform envelope using a Hilbert Transform. The envelope is smoothed using a moving average filter (the Smoothing parameter defines the size of the averaging window). The click is trimmed as follows. First the peak of the waveform envelope is found. The length of the click is defined as the point at which the click falls Peak threshold dB below the peak. The center of the click is then the middle of this snippet. The click is then trimmed from the center of the click.\nAmplitude normalisation If there is a very loud click compared to a template it’s correlation score will be different to that of a very quiet click of with exactly the same waveform. It is therefore a good idea to normalise the waveform before it is compared the match click classifier. The types of normalisation are\n\nnorm - this is the default - the click is divided by it’s RMS amplitude.\npeak to peak this can be useful for some types of shorter click e.g. dolphins - the click is divided by it’s peak to peak amplitude.\nnone no normalisation (not recommended).\n\n\n\nTemplate settings\nThe matched click classifier has two templates, a match and a reject. The match template should match a stereotypical click of the target species and the reject template can either be a click from a confounding species (e.g. dolphin) or blank. Selecting the drop-down menu from the Import button allows for a selection of some default templates. Custom templates can be imported by selecting the Import button. Custom templates can either be a .csv. or .mat file using the following format.\n.csv - the first row are the waveform measurements from -1 to 1 (make sure you save with a sufficient number of decimal points). The second row and first column is the sample rate in sample per second.\n.mat - a .mat file that contains two variables named sR and waveform. sR is the sample rate in samples per second and waveform is a 1D array containing the waveform for the template form -1 to 1. Arrays of click structures imported using the PAMGuard to MATLAB library can also be used. The first channel of the first click in a list of clicks structures will be imported as the template. The click structure should be names clicks and the sample rate should be saved as a seperate variable named sR in sampes per second.\nThe match and reject templates are plotted to provide a user with some visualisation of the classifier settings - the drop down menu allows the user to select different ways to plot the templates and is purely for visualisation purposes so makes no difference to classifier settings.\nthreshold is the threshold at which a click is classified. If the difference between the match and reject templates is above the threshold value then the click is classified.\nThe + button can be used to add more tabs. Each tab contains a click/reject template pair and unique threshold setting. A click is classified if at least one of the match/reject templates passes it’s set threshold.",

It is core module, fully integrated into PAMGuard’s display and data management system and can be used in real time or for post processing data. It can therefore be used as a classifier for almost any acoustic signal and can integrate into multiple types of acoustic analysis workflows, for example post analysis of recorder data or used as part of real time localisation workflow.",

    "section": "How it works",
    "text": "How it works\nThe deep learning module accepts raw data from different types of data sources, e.g. from the Sound Acquisition module, clicks and clips. It segments data into equal sized chunks with a specified overlap. Each chunk is passed through a set of transforms which convert the data into a format which is accepted by the specified deep learning model. These transforms are either manually set up by the user or, if a specific type of framework has been used to train a deep learning model, then can be automatically set up by PAMGuard. Currently there are three implemented frameworks\n\nA diagram of how the deep learning module works in PAMGuard. An input waveform is segmented into chunks. A series of transforms are applied to each chunk creating the input for the deep learning model. The transformed chunks are sent to the model. The results from the model are saved and can be viewed in real time (e.g. mitigation) or in post processing (e.g. data from SoundTraps).\n\nGeneric Model\nA generic model allows a user to load any model compatible with the djl (PyTorch (JIT), Tenserflow, ONXX) library and then manually set up a series of transforms using PAMGuard’s transform library. It is recommended that users use an existing framework instead of a generic model as these models will automatically generate the required transforms.\n\n\nAnimalSpot\nANIMAL-SPOT is a deep learning based framework which was initially designed for killer whale sound detection in noise heavy underwater recordings (see Bergler et al. (2019)). It has now been expanded to a be species independent framework for training acoustic deep learning models using PyTorch and Python. Imported AnimalSpot models will automatically set up their own data transforms and output classes.\n\n\nKetos\nKetos is an acoustic deep learning framework based on Tensorflow and developed by MERIDIAN. It has excellent resources and tutorials and Python libraries can be installed easily via pip. Imported Ketos (.ktpb) models will automatically set up their own data transforms and output classes.\n\n\nKoogu\nKoogu is a Python package which allows users to train a deep learning model. Koogu helps users by integrating with some frequency used annotation programs and provides tools to train and test classifiers. Imported Koogu models (.kgu) will automatically set up their own data transforms and output classes.\n\n\nPAMGuardZip\nPAMGuard zip models consist of a deep learning model (either a Tensorflow saved_model.pb or PyTorch *.py model) alongside a PAMGuard metdata file (.pdtf*) within a zip archive. The metadata file contains all the information needed for PAMGaurd to set up the model. PAMGuard will import the zip file, decompress it and search for the relevent deep learning model and metadata file then set up all settings accordingly. This framework allows users to easily share pre-tested PAMGuard compatible models.\nNext: Creating and Configuring the Deep Learning module",

Detections can be reclassified by selecting the Settings &gt; Raw Deep Learning Classifier &gt; Reclassify detections. Select the data range in the reprocessing dialog e.g. Loaded Data and select Start.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The whistle contour is automatically extracted from the spectrogram by stepping through the spectra one time slice at a time and measuring the peak frequency for each slice within a specific frequency bin. The upper and lower limits of the search bin are defined by the peak frequency of the previous time slice +/- the noise sensitivity (as defined in the Rocca Parameters window). The frequency bin of the first time slice is determined by the user-selected start frequency +/- the noise sensitivity.\n\nAdjusting the Noise Sensitivity\nIf the contour does not match the underlying whistle, the first step should be to adjust the noise sensitivity.\n\nDecreasing the sensitivity narrows the frequency band used when searching for the peak frequency in the next time slice. A smaller band means the extraction algorithm is less likely to jump from the whistle contour to a nearby noisy peak. However, a smaller band also means that if the algorithm does jump to a nearby noisy peak, there is less chance it will be able to jump back to the whistle contour.\nIncreasing the sensitivity widens the frequency band used when searching for the peak frequency in the next time slice. A wider band increases the chances that an extraction gone off-track and following noise will be able to jump back to the whistle contour. However, a wider band also increases the chances of going off-track in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA button is provided in the top toolbar to quickly adjust noise sensitivity. The spectrogram will automatically update with the recalculated contour each time the sensitivity is changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting the highpass/lowpass filters\nThe highpass and lowpass filters limit the contour extraction algorithm to only function within a specific frequency band. The highpass filter defines the lower bound, and the lowpass filter defines the upper bound. Specify a filter by typing in the desired frequency and hitting , or hitting the  button and clicking on the desired frequency in the spectrogram. The filter is displayed on the spectrogram as a red horizontal line. If the extraction algorithm finds a peak frequency lower than the highpass filter specified, the peak frequency will be set to the value of the highpass filter. Similarly, if the extraction algorithm finds a peak frequency higher than the lowpass filter specified, the peak frequency will be set to the value of the lowpass filter.\nThe filters can be reset by clicking the  button.\n\n\nAdjusting the contour points manually\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual contour points can be dragged manually to new positions. In order to view the points, move the mouse over the spectrogram and press the left mouse button. Try to move the mouse to a position away from the current whistle contour, to avoid accidentally dragging a contour point. Contour points will be displayed as light green dots.\n\n\n\n\n\nContour points can only be dragged vertically. That is, the frequency can be changed but not the time slice. Once the contour point to be moved is determined, position the mouse over top of the point and press and hold the mouse button. The contour points will again be displayed as light green dots, but the point closest to the cursor will have a red circle. Move the mouse up or down to the desired frequency, and release the mouse button.\n\n\n\nOnce a contour point has been moved, it will be locked in the new position even if the contour is recalculated by adjusting the noise sensitivity, modifying filters or clicking the  button. In this way, if the contour extraction algorithm has followed noise instead of the desired whistle, the user can move a point to the correct position and get the extraction back on track. The contour point can still be moved manually, and clicking the  button will unlock all locked points.\nPrevious: Spectrogram Popup Window\nNext: Whistle and Encounter Classification",

    "text": "ROCCA saves three different files during manual whistle contour extraction and classification: whistle wav file clip, contour points and contour variable measurements. During automated click or whistle analysis, ROCCA only saves the measured variables to the contour variables file. ROCCA will also saves school stats automatically every five minutes, as well as when the  button is clicked.\nIf a database module is being used, ROCCA will also save the data to two tables: Rocca_Whistle_Stats and Rocca_Encounter_Stats.\n\nWhistle Clip\nThe whistle clip is saved with a wav format to the output directory. The start and end points of the clip are defined by the start and end points originally selected by the user in the spectrogram popup. The channels saved to the clip file are specified in the ROCCA Parameters window.\nThe filename is defined by the user in the ROCCA Parameters window\n\n\nContour Points\nThe time/frequency pair for each contour point in the extracted whistle contour is saved in CSV format in the output directory. The duty cycle, the energy in a frequency bin around the peak frequency (as defined in the ROCCA Parameters window), and the RMS value of the amplitude are also saved.\nThe filename is defined by the user in the ROCCA Parameters window\n\n\nContour Variables\nThe variables measured from the current whistle contour/click, as well as the species classification (if a whistle), are saved in CSV format in the output directory. The information from each whistle/click is appended to the end of the file and the file is never overwritten. Thus, this file will continue to collect classification information every time PAMGuard/ROCCA is run.\nOther saved information for each whistle includes the sound source, the analysis date and time, the encounter number, and any notes included in the ROCCA Parameters Notes tab. The end of each row lists the name of the random forest model, the random forest tree votes for each species and a list of the species included in the classifier. The species names were added to each row instead of the header line because the header would be created based on information from the very first whistle contour analyzed only. If the classification model is changed for subsequent analysis, the species list may be different and no longer match the header. By including the species list in the row, the user is always able to verify which species were included in the classification algorithm for that particular whistle contour or click.\nThe filename is specified in the ROCCA Parameters window.\nIf a database module is being used, the data will also be saved to the Rocca_Whistle_Stats table.\n\n\nEncounter Stats\nAll encounter numbers, with the species classification break-down for each, are saved as a CSV file in the output directory. Also included for each encounter number is the overall encounter duration, the duration of the whistles only, the duration of the clicks only, the number of whistles/clicks, the minimum/maximum/average time between whistles/clicks, the number of whistles/clicks per second, the whistle/click density (the sum of the individual durations / encounter length), the whistle/clicks overlap (the total number of seconds that two whistles/clicks overlap), the cumulative random forest tree vote totals for each species, as well as a species list and the overall encounter classification (based on the species with the highest cumulative tree vote total).\nEach time the encounter stats file is saved, either through the auto-save function or by the user pressing the  button, the file is overwritten in order to update any renamed encounter numbers. Since an encounter number can be renamed but never deleted, no information will be lost when overwriting an old file during a single PAMGuard session. HOWEVER, if PAMGuard is closed and restarted the file will be overwritten with blank data and all prior information will be lost. The file is checked during PAMGuard startup, and if it exists the user is given the opportunity to rename it before it is lost, and/or load the existing data back into the system.\nNote that when examining a particular encounter number, the user should refer to the species list at the end of the row instead of the species listed in the header. The header information is taken from the first encounter number listed; if subsequent encounter numbers use a different classification model, the species may change and this change would not be reflected in the header.\nThe filename is specified in the ROCCA Parameters window.\nIf a database module is being used, the data will also be saved to the Rocca_Encounter_Stats table.\nPrevious: ROCCA Sidebar",

In addition to classifying individual whistle, ROCCA will also classify the Encounter Number to species.

Also note that the user will not be allowed to duplicate encounter numbers\nClassify Encounter: classifies the encounter one of two ways. If an Encounter Classifier model has been loaded and both whistle and click encounter stats have been calculated, a random forest classifier is used to classify the encounter based on the output of the whistle and click classifiers. If an Encounter Classifier model has not been loaded, or if either the whistle or click encounter stats are not being calculated, the encounter is classified as the species with the highest cumulative percentage of votes.\nSave Encounter: overwrites the current Encounter Stats file (as defined in the ROCCA Parameters window) with the current list of encounters and statistics. Encounter statistics are also automatically saved every 5 minutes.\nNew Encounter: create a new encounter number\nWhistle Start: lists the time and frequency of the first user-selected point on the spectrogram\nWhistle End: lists the time and frequency of the second user-selected point on the spectrogram.

There are two values stored for each species: the number of times a whistle/click has been classified to that species (displayed), and a cumulative total of all the percentage tree votes for the species (not displayed). When a new whistle/click classification is saved to an encounter number, the count of the classified species is increased by one and the percentage tree votes for each species are added to the corresponding cumulative totals.\nThe encounter is classified in one of two ways:\n\nIf an encounter classifier has been loaded, the vector of encounter parameters and the random forest probabilities from the whistle and click classifiers are analysed with the encounter random forest and the encounter is classified as the species with the highest percentage of tree votes.\n2. If no encounter classifier has been selected by the user, the encounter is classified as the species with the highest cumulative percentage of tree votes. Note that this may be different than the species most often classified - the value shown in the sidebar species list. If the highest cumulative percentage of tree votes falls below the school threshold (as specified in the ROCCA Parameters window), the detection is classified as Ambiguous.\n\nPrevious: Contour Extraction / Manipulation\nNext: ROCCA Sidebar",

    "text": "The Whistle Classifier takes detected whistles from the Whistle and Moan detector and attempts to classify them to species.\nThe Whistle classifier does not attempt to classify individual detected whistles. Instead it collects information on many whistles and statistically analyses them as a group to determine species.\nThe classifier must be trained with a sample of whistles from each species. While some standard training sets are available through the PAMGuard web site, it is highly likely that whistles of a given species will vary between regions and sub species and may also evolve over time. The Whistle Classifier therefore allows you to train it using your own samples of whistles from known species.\nThe workings of the classifier are described in the paper Douglas Gillespie, Marjolaine Caillat, Jonathan Gordon, Paul White; Automatic detection and classification of odontocete whistles.

The lower panel is overlaid with the output of the Whistle and Moan detector. Clearly some of the quieter whistles have been missed altogether, while others have been broken into multiple parts.\nThe breaking up of whistles into parts can be very dependent on the local noise conditions and would not therefore be consistent between encounters with a given species. A classifier requiring complete whistles would therefore be expected to perform very poorly.\nThe PAMGuard Whistle Classifier therefore works by taking short fragments of whistles and accumulates statistics over many fragments. Since the level of “natural” fragmentation due to noise will vary, all detected whistles are first broken into fragments of the same length prior to classification. While fragmenting whistles in this way is discarding potentially useful information, it creates an overall improvement in classifier stability\nFor each whistle fragment, three parameters are measured:\n\nThe start frequency\nThe slope\nThe curvature\n\nDistributions of these three parameters are built up over time, then once sufficient fragments have been accumulated, the mean, the standard deviation and the skew (lopsidedness) of each distribution is measured, giving a total of nine parameters which are used by the statistical classifier, i.e.\n\nThe mean start frequency\nThe standard deviation of the distribution of start frequencies\nThe skew of the mean frequency distribution\nThe mean slope\netc. …\n\n\nReferences\nGillespie, D., Caillat, M., Gordon, J., and White, P.

Training data will be in the form of a number of .wctd files containing extracted whistle contours from the Whistle and Moan detector\nSelect the file folder containing your .wctd files. The files can all be in the same folder or can be split into sub folders, in which case you should check the “Select Sub folders” option.\nLimit Frequency Search Range - The frequency range to use. Contours outside this range will be discarded.\nThis is useful if there is low or high frequency noise in the system which you wish to exclude from the training process.\nYou can also require the classifier to only use whistle contours over a certain number of FFT bins long. Again, this can be useful if there are short bits of noise in the training data sample.\n\nspecies names\nWhen the wctd files were created, the species name (either input by the user of taken from the folder name of the source audio file) was written into each file. Species names from the .wctd files are used by default during the classifier training. However, it is possible to override the species names in the .wctd files by organising you .wctd files into sub folders with different names and selecting the “Use folder names as species names” option.\nThis allows you to merge data sets which may have been given slightly different names by different analyst (for instance, different people may have labelled training data for Bottlenose dolphin as “BND”, “Bottlenose”, “TT”, “Tursiops”, etc. It also allows you to merge species into groups, for instance, you might have a new “Small dolphin” category containing data for both common and striped dolphin.\n\n\n\nRun Training\nTo run the training, set the following parameters:\nClassifier Type - Two discriminant functions are available, Linear Discriminant Analysis and a Mahalanobis Distances Classifier.\nFragment Length - How long the fragments of whistle fed into the classifier should be.\nSection length - how many fragments to accumulate before extracting parameters from the distribution and running a classification.\nMinimum probability threshold - sets a minimum probability threshold for classification. If the classifier probability for the best class falls below this threshold, then the whistle section is marked as unclassified.\nNumber of test bootstraps - The number of randomised trials to run when testing classifier performance\nBatch Testing of Multiple Values - This button will open an additional dialog which allows you to enter a range of values for the fragment length, section length and probability threshold. The bootstrap is then carried out for each set of parameters and the output dumped to a text file. Examination of the text file help to decide on the optimum values for these parameters.\nPress the “Start Training” button and wait while the classifier training process runs.\nProgress will be indicated in the bar at the bottom of the window and also as text output in the right hand display panel.\n\n\nTraining Output\nThe training process produces a number of matrices which will control the classification process. These are automatically stored into the standard PAMGuard settings file you are currently using.\nYou can also export the classifier settings to a Whistle Classifier Settings (*.wcsd) file for archiving and easy sharing with other users so that they can set up the same classifier without requiring access to the training data set.\nPrevious: Collecting Training Data\nNext: Running the Whistle Classifier",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThe click classifier with frequency sweep was added to PAMGuard in 2010 to provide a wider choice of species identification parameters, particularly for the detection of beaked whales.\nOperation is similar to that of the Basic click Classifier in so much that a number of different tests can be carried out on each click and the click will have to satisfy all of those tests in order to be classified.\n\n\n\nGeneral options\nIn the general options section, enter the species name, a unique identification code and select the symbol to be used for this species on the click detector display.\n\nChannel options\nClick detection is generally conducted on more than one channel. If this is the case, then the click classifier can be set to either:\n\nRequire positive identification on all channels individually\nRequire positive identification on only one channel\nUse mean parameter values over all channels\n\n\n\nRestricting the click length\nClick waveforms from the click detector are generally longer than the click itself. This is partly due to the pre and post samples added to the waveform but can also be caused by the click arriving at different times on different channels. The addition of extra waveform data before or after the click has little effect if the click has a high signal to noise ratio, but for quiet clicks, the additional data is a significant source of noise for some parameter measurements. There is therefore an option to restrict the length of the data used in the parameter extractions. If this option is used, then the peak of the waveform envelope is found (see Click Length below) and an equal amount of wave data taken from each side of the envelope maximum.\nGenerally the click length should be set to a power of 2 (e.g. 128, 256, 512, etc) since the FFT’s used in many of the calculations require data that is an exact power of 2 long. Other values can be used, in which case the shortened data will be padded with zeros prior to FFT calculations.\n\n\n\nWaveform Options\nThe first tab “Waveform Options” controls classification parameters relating to the click waveform\n\nPre Filtering\nSelect this option if you want to filter the click prior to parameter extraction. Generally measurements such as the click length will be more accurate if unnecessary noise is first filtered from the click\n\n\nAmplitude Range\nThis option can be used to exclude very quiet of loud clicks. Quiet clicks in particular tend to cause false classification since their properties are poorly defined so they tend to mis-classify at random\n\n\nClick Length\nThe click length is measured by first calculating the analytic waveform (or signal envelope) of the click using the Hilbert transform of the waveform data\nThis is then smoothed using a moving average filter defined by the user (smoothing parameter in dialog).\nThe maximum of the smoothed envelope is then found and the click length taken as the length of the data between points either side of that maximum which remain above the maximum value minus the threshold (Threshold parameter in dialog).\nThe test is passed if the click length lies within the range set by the user (Length range parameters in dialog).\n\n\nZero Crossings\nSome species of whale produce frequency modulated clicks, i.e. the click frequency changes during the course of the click.\nThe power spectrum of a click is an average of the spectral energy over the duration of the click and is therefore unable to show changes in frequency during the course of the click.\nAlthough it is possible to extract more detailed frequency information using a Wigner-Ville transform of the waveform data. These are slow to compute and therefore not suitable for real time classification.\nThe classifier therefore extracts frequency information by examining zero crossings of the waveform data.\nA zero crossing is defined as the signal waveform going from a positive to a negative value or vice-versa. The classifier searches the waveform for zero crossings only within the region of the click between the thresholded limits from the click length estimation described above.\nOnce zero crossings have been found, the frequency between each zero crossing is calculated. If there are three or more zero crossings (permitting two or more estimates of frequency) the frequency sweep is calculated by fitting a linear model of frequency against time.\nTwo tests can then be applied to the data. The first is the total number of zero crossings which must lie within the range set in the dialog. The second is the frequency sweep estimated from the zero crossing data.\n\n\n\nSpectrum Options\nThe second tab controls classification parameters extracted from the clicks spectrum\n\n\nEnergy Bands\nThe energy band test compares the acoustic energy in a test band with the energy in two control bands.\nThe user should enter the frequency ranges of each band and a threshold value for each of the control bands. The test is passed if the test band energy exceeds each of the control band energies by more than the threshold values.\nIf only one control band is required, set both frequency limits of the second control band to zero.\n\n\nPeak and Mean Frequency\nThe peak and mean frequency are measured from the power spectrum of the click waveform.\n\n\nSearch and integration range\nThe peak search and the frequencies over which the mean frequency is summed can be restricted using the search and integration range parameters in the dialog.\nThe power spectrum can also be smoothed using a moving average filter to remove noisy spikes from the spectral data.\n\n\nPeak Frequency\nIf the peak frequency test is enabled, the peak frequency (taken as the highest point in the smoothed spectral data between the limits of the Search and Integration range) must lie between the limits entered in the dialog.\n\n\nPeak Width\nThe width of the spectral peak is measured by first finding the amplitude of the power spectrum at the peak frequency. The peak width is taken as the frequency range of the data either side of that peak which are at an amplitude above the peak amplitude minus the threshold (threshold parameter in dialog). The test is passed if the width of the peak lies within the set range.\n\n\nMean Frequency\nThe mean frequency is calculated using\n\nwhere\ni is the range of frequency bins within the search and integration range\nI is the intensity of the spectrum at each frequency bin i\nf is the frequency (Hz) at each frequency bin i\nThe test is passed if the mean frequency lies within the set range.\n\n\n\nOther Options\nThe third tab controls other options\n\n\nAlarm\nYou can create an audible alarm by setting an alarm on the tab and by enabling it on the more general classifiction panel\n\n\n\nSpecies Default settings\nThe ‘Species Defaults’ button allows the user to use stored standard settings for beaked whale and harbour porpoise classifiers.\nPrevious: Basic Click Classification\nNext: Tracking and Click Train Identification",

    "text": "Overview\nIndividual clicks detected by the click detector can be classified using one of two different click classifiers. The first, Basic click Classifier is the same as the click classifier in the IFAW RainbowClick software. The basic classifier is generally adequate for the classification of high frequency harbour porpoise clicks and is primarily retained for backwards compatibility with the RainbowClick classifier. The second Classifier With Frequency Sweep uses additional classification parameters and is more suitable for the detection of lower frequency odontocete clicks, particularly those of beaked whales.\nThe classifier is set up from the Click Detection&gt;Click Classification menu.\n\n\n\nClickTypes (10K)\n\n\n\n\nClick Classifier Selection\nSelect the type of click classifier you wish to use from the drop down list. This will either be the Basic click Classifier or the Classifier With Frequency Sweep.\nYou must also check the ‘Run classification online’ box if you want clicks to be processed as they are detected.\nYou should check the ‘Discard unclassified clicks’ box if you want clicks which do not pass any of the classification criteria to be discarded. Use this feature with great caution and only when you are confident that the classifiers are working well for the clicks that you do want.\n\n\nClick Types\nThe click classification dialog contains a list of defined click types.\nIf more than one type is defined, then each click is tested against each type in sequence and the click is classified as belonging to the first type with a matching set of classification criteria.\nIf the click does not match the criteria of any of the classifiers, then it is unclassified.\nUse the New, Edit and Delete buttons to add, modify and remove items from the list.\nIf an audible alarm has been associated with this click type, checking/unchecking the alarm column will enable/disable it. Alarms can be associated with click types in the Individual Click Classification dialog (press the Edit button to open the dialog).\nEach click is checked against the different click types in sequence. As soon as one set of criteria is matched, the classifier will stop searching other click types. It is therefore sometimes important to arrange the different types in a particular order. Use the Up and Down buttons to move different click types up and down in the list.\nIndividual species classifiers can be enabled or disabled, for example if you wish to temporarily stop checking for a particular click type.\nClassified clicks can also be discarded. For example, if there was a particular noise source causing false triggers of the click detector (e.g. a depth sounder), it may be possible to set up a classifier for those detections and immediately discard them.\nIf either the New or the Edit button is pressed, the Individual Click Classification dialog will be displayed. The behaviour of this dialog will depend on the type of classifier selected.\nPrevious: Click Detector Graphic Overlays\nNext: Basic Click Classification",

    "text": "The PAMGuard viewer click detector has the ability to allow manual marking of events. Events usually consist of a group of clicks associated with one acoustic encounter of a particular species. Event information is saved to the database and in certain situations, such as when using towed arrays, can be used to localise an animal?s position.\nCreating an Event\nTo mark an event bring up the bearing/amplitude time display (in the Click Detector tab). The Figure shows a porpoise click train which needs to be marked and stored as an event. Note that the bearing time display is very similar to the online version just that instead of the trigger window you get a Wigner plot as default setting.\n\n\n\nClickTrain\n\n\nTo see the classified clicks better (in this case porpoise clicks - the red triangles) you can untick the box at the top of the window ‘Unclassified clicks’. The bearing time display will now only show the classified clicks (depending on your settings you have more options i.e. echos, other species, etc.). Right click on a click and select ‘Label click…’.\n\n\n\nLabelClick_1\n\n\nThis will bring up the event dialog box. Here you can create a new event by selecting the ‘New Event’ button or add the click to an existing event by selecting any event from the Event list.\n\n\n\nEvents_1\n\n\nWhen creating a new event the species/event type can be selected from the drop down menu. To add a new species/event type to the database simply right click on the drop down menu and select ‘Edit list’.\n\n\n\nCreateNewEvents\n\n\nIn the Lookup Editor window select ‘Add Item’ and create a Code, Text and Symbol for your new species/event type. Press ok. Now you can select your new Event type/species from the drop down list in the click event dialog (previous figure). The Estimated number of animals and the comment are optional but always useful to fill in. (Note: Dont worry about the event number, PAMGuard creates an ID automatically.)\n\n\n\nLookup\n\n\nMultiple clicks can be selected using the advanced area selection tool. Double click on the bearing/amplitude time display. This will bring up a dotted line which you can use to draw around a group of clicks. By joining up the ends of the dotted line the selected area should appear grey.\n\n\n\nMarkingAnEvent_1\n\n\nAll the clicks within this grey area can be added to an event by right clicking inside the grey area and selecting ‘Label Clicks’ or use the key short cut ‘Ctrl+L’. Note that there are also other options available such as removing clicks from a certain event etc. So if you made a mistake, don?t panick. Other useful tools for marking an event include the amplitude selector and zoom selection.\n\n\n\nLabelMultipleClicks\n\n\nFollowing the described steps your event is saved. You can now localise it with target motion analysis.\nAll events are saved in the database. To get an overview about your events go to ‘Click Detection’ and then ‘Show events’.\n\n\n\nShowEvents\n\n\nDepending on your selection you see all events in your data set or only the ones which are in the current period. Right click on an event and you have the option for editing, deleting or going to the event. This comes in handy when you want to move between events.\n\n\n\nEventList\n\n\nEvents which contain clicks with bearing information can be viewed in the map tab- simply right click and select ‘Click Detector, Tracked Clicks’. If using a towed array events can be localised using the target motion analysis module. Localisation information will also be displayed on the map.\n\n\n\nMapEvents\n\n\nYou can also send Events to Rocca for click analysis. Go to ‘Click Detection’ and then ‘Rocca Measurement’. A new window will open up displaying all of the currently defined events.

JAMIE: WHAT DOES the DELETE OLD DATABASE ENTRIES DO?\n\n\n\nClickProcessing\n\n\nThe parameters you can change are:\n\nReclassify clicks\nThis brings you to the click classification. Here you can change either the click parameters or add a new classification.\n\n\nEcho Detection\nThis opens the Echo Detection window. Here you can change the parameters for echo classification.\n\n\n\nEchoDetection\n\n\n\n\nRecalculate click delays\nThis opens the delay measurement window. Here you can alter the setting of how click delays are calculated.\n\n\n\nClickDelay\n\n\nYou can choose either of the two options, both or none.\nOption 1: Filter data before measurement\nThis option has the following settings:\n\n\n\nFFT_Filtersettings\n\n\nOption 2: Use wave form envelope. This takes the Hilbert Transform of the wave and uses this to calculate time delays instead of the true waveform. This is useful for spectraly pure signals which have characteristic wave envelopes, such as Harbour Porpoise clicks.\n\n\nClick bearings\nThis option allows you to recalculate click bearings. These may have changed due to altering the spacing between hydrophone elements or perhaps you have recalculated the click delays, hence the bearings will have changed.\nYou can run all 4 reclassification options at once or tick the ones which are suitable for the analysis. Press ‘Start’ to beginn the recalculation process. You can see how far advanced the recaclulation process is in the progress bar. During re-processing the cancel button will change to a ‘Stop’ button and when the process is finished it will change to a ‘Close’ button. When recalculating large data sets the Close button might not appear after the last file. Just press Stop instead.\nPrevious: Marking out Events\nNext: Offline Click Analysis Tools",

    "text": "If you are using a SountTrap recording device with built in click detection from Ocean Instruments, you may need to use a modified version of the Click Detector.\nThe SoundTrap click detector allows you to detect and store clicks at high frequencies (say 384kS/sec), suitable for odontocete echolocation clicks, and at the same time, record audio data files at a lower frequency (e.g. 96 or 48kS/sec). This optimises disk space usage and makes long deployments of several months possible without running out of data storage.\nHaving two sample rates present within a single PAMGuard configuration is possible using Decimator modules. However such configurations become particularly complicated to configure when the sample rate of the recorded files is lower than the sample rate of the click detector.\n\nWe therefore recommend that you use a modified version of the Click Detector, which manages it’s own sample rate and channel information based on information extracted from the SoundTrap data.\nNote that the SoundTrap click detector should only be used for clicks automatically detected by the SoundTrap. If you want to detect clicks from the SoundTrap recordings, then use a normal Click Detector in the normal way.\n\nCreating an instance of the SoundTrap Click Detector\nFrom the File&gt;Add modules&gt;Detectors menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display, select ‘SoundTrap Click Detector’ near the bottom of the Detectors list. Enter a descriptive name for the new detector and press Ok.\n\n\nImporting SoundTrap Data\nSoundTrap data are stored in proprietary files called SUD files.\nThere are two ways in which you can get data from SUD files into the SoundTrap Click Detector.\n\nThe Old Way\nThe ‘standard’ way of using SoundTrap data was to inflate all of the data from the compressed SUD files. For details of this process, see the SoundTrap user manuals and the SoundTrap Host software.\nNormally, several inflated files are generated from each sud file:\n\nA wav file: Audio data in standard wav file format\nAn XML file: Metadata on the SoundTrap configuration, file start times in various formats, etc.\nIf the click detector was running BCL and DWV files, which contain the times of clicks and click waveforms respectively.\n\nTo convert the SUD files to the binary storage format used by PAMGuard, working in the PAMGuard Viewer, create a Binary Store, a SoundTrap Click Detector and also create a ‘SoundTrap Detector Import’ module. Then use the import module to import the BCL and DWV data into PAMGuard. Once imported you can run Click Classifiers and use other Click Detector offline functions to mark events, etc.\nIf you want to run additional analysis on the WAV file data (for example to make noise measurements or to detect whistles), create a different PAMGuard configuration to process those data.\n\n\nThe (better) New Way\nCurrent versions of PAMGuard can read SUD files directly, without first unpacking them into WAV, XML, BCL and DWV files. This not only reduces the amount of disk space you need by about x4, but also saves a lot of time.\nBetter still, you can now set up PAMGuard in normal mode to simultaneously process the audio data in the SUD file with one set of detectors, and simultaneously extract the click detector data into appropriate files for a SoundTrap Click Detector.\nStart PAMGuard in Normal Mode and add a Sound Acquisition module. Add a SoundTrap Click Detector, a Binary Store store and a Database module (optional). In the Sound Acquisition dialog select a single SUD file or a folder of SUD files. At this point, the SoundTrap Click Detector will be automatically configured with the correct sample rate (which won’t be the sample rate displayed in the Sound Acquisition module).\nConfigure any Click Classifiers you want to be run on the SoundTrap click data as it is imported.\nYou can then add any other detectors and measurement processes you want to run on the SoundTrap audio data, this may include instances of the normal Click Detector module if you want to detect clicks in the lower frequency audio data.\nProcess the data in the normal way and clicks will automatically be generated within the SoundTrap click detector\nFurther process you data using the PAMGuard Viewer in the normal way.",

    "text": "Before creating a GPL module, you will need a Sound Acquisition module and an FFT (Spectrogram) Engine. If these do not already exist you will be prompted to create them when you add the GPL Module. In the File Menu, go to Detectors / Generalised Power Law Detector and the module will be added to your PAMGuard configuration.\nNote that the GPL detector is most useful for the detection of low frequency baleen whale sounds. If your raw data are high frequency, then consider adding a Decimator module between the Sound Acquisition and FFT modules to lower the frequency of the data.\n\nFFT Data source\nOpen the GPL detector dialog from the main Settings menu and select the FFT data source and indicate which channels you want the detector to operate on. The detector will operate independently on each selected channel.\nNote the frequency and time resolutions of the FFT data which are displayed in the dialog. If these are not suitable, then make adjustments in the FFT module before returning to the GPL configuration.\n\n\n\nSpectrogram Whitening\nThe GPL detector uses advanced signal processing methods to estimate a median background noise which is then subtracted from the data. The Whitening Time Period is the time over which this background is measured. When processing starts, it can take up to two of these whitening periods for the initial background measurement to stabilise. For this reason, data are often processed in blocks, so the software can scan back and forth within the same block of data to make the background measurement, then search for detections.\n\nBlocked Processing\nIn this mode, data are read in in blocks of the length of the whitening period, the background is measured on that block of data, and then detections made within the same block. This works well for offline processing of duty cycled recordings. However, when processing data in real time, no detections will be visible to the user until the end of each block, and the detections may scroll off the screen before you’ve had a chance to look at them!\nBlock First\nIn this mode, the first block of data is processed exactly as for Blocked Processing. After that, the system then switches to continuous processing, where the background is continually updated based on the data within the preceding whitening period. After the initial block, this provides smoother displays than Blocked Processing. Output should be very similar, however the background measurement at a moment in time will be slightly different, so results may vary slightly. This mode could be used either for real time processing or for offline processing of recorded data.\nBlock First\nIn this mode, there is no blocking of data and all background assessments are made on preceding data. This mode is therefore NOT suitable for offline processing of recordings, since detection will not be possible within the first two whitening time periods of each file. However, for long term real time monitoring, if you’re not too fussed about the first minutes of data, it would be possible to use this processing mode.\nPrevious: Overview\nNext: Detection Parameters",

If a sample rate is many times the frequency of the sound you’re interested in, then you may find you need a very long FFT length to get a sensible time and frequency resolution.\n\nThe frequency resolution of a spectrogram, in Hz, is the acoustic sample rate divided by the FFT Length.\nThe time resolution and time step size, in seconds, are the FFT Length and FFT Hop divided by the sample rate.\n\nThis means that data with a sample rate of 2000 Hz, and FFT length of 2048 samples and an FFT hop of 128 samples will have time and frequency resolutions of 64ms and 0.98 Hz respectively.

    "text": "The GPL detector has several parameters controlling the frequency range of data to search for sounds, the power law to apply, duration of sounds, etc. The PAMGuard implementation also provides some pre-set default values provided by Tyler Helble which work reasonably well for a number of species. Note however that all parameters may require adjustment in different noise environments.\n\nMinimum and Maximum Frequency\nThese are the minimum and maximum frequencies used by the detector for spectrogram whitening, background measurement and detection.\nWhitening scale factor\nThis is a scaling factor used to increase the level of background subtraction during the whitening process. Generally it should be 1.0, but can be increased to 1.5 for noisy data.\nPower law’s (time and frequency)\nThese are the variables &nu1 and &nu2 in Equation 6 in Helble et al 2011. The two power law parameters have slightly different properties, in that &nu1 is operating on a spectrogram whitened over time and is therefore better at rejecting constant noise sources, whereas &nu2 operates on a spectrogram whitened over frequency, so is better at rejecting broad band transients. However, the effects of the two parameters are broadly similar. Overall, the sum of both &nu1 and &nu2 should be around 2.5 for the detection of narrow band tonal systems.\nDetection ON and OFF Thresholds\nFor a detection to occur, the detection statistic must rise above the ON threshold. When this occurs, the detector will then search backwards and forwards in time and select all data which were above the lower OFF threshold.\nThe values are expressed as factors, simple ratios of the power law statistic compared to background noise. As a guide, approximate decibel values based on the threshold and magnitude of the power law parameters are also given.\nMinimum Gap\nMany detections, particularly of lower amplitude sounds, will rise and fall above the detection thresholds more than once due to varying amplitude over time. If the gap between subsequent peaks above threshold is less than the minimum gap, multiple small detections will be joined together into a single large detection. The value is entered as the number of FFT time bins, but is also displayed in seconds, based on the entered value and configuration of the spectrogram module.\nMinimum and Maximum Length\nThese are the minimum and maximum lengths of a detection in seconds. Any detection that is shorter than or longer than these limits will be rejected. The values are entered in seconds, but also displayed in FFT time bins, based on the entered value and configuration of the spectrogram module.\nPrevious: Configuration\nNext: Contour detection",

The dialog will not allow you to enter in a name that is already taken. Note that target configuration names are case sensitive.\n\nGeneral Parameters\nOnce a target configuration is added, it will be displayed in the configuration area, showing the default values for the general parameters. These general parameters are discussed in brief below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime and Frequency Resolutions\nThe time resolution and frequency resolution parameters provide configurable values that are used in conjunction with the audio source properties in order to derive the signal processing settings for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) process found at the start of the processing stream. The FFT process operates on the raw input data, converting it to the frequency domain. A Hann window (raised cosine) is used in all cases. Note that changes in sample rate do not require a change to the various settings.\nFor very short signals (&lt; 50ms) the time_res should be on the order of the signal duration to twice that. Setting it to be much larger than the signal duration will reduce the detectors ability to detect low SNR (weak) signals.\nFor longer signals, a time_res less than the signal is appropriate, and helps to get better detection timing. The default of 0.1 seconds is often appropriate. The data is still averaged over the length of a signal (using the signal window parameter) in the Normalizer block. This is a sliding window, which is more appropriate for several reasons.\nThe frequency resolution is normally set to freq_res = 1 / (2 * time_res) which results in 50% overlap.\nAlgorithm\nThis parameter specifies the normalization algorithm that is to be used for the target configuration. There are two possible normalizers: Decaying Average and Block Average. The Decaying Average algorithm uses feedback to generate estimates similar to the Click Detector. The Block Average algorithm averages a specified block of data history.\nIn general, the block averager is a better choice because it doesn’t have a long-term memory. For signal processors the block average is like an FIR filter, whereas the decaying averager is like an IIR filter.\nThe normalizer produces a likelihood ratio L = S / N.\nHere are some guidelines for normalization:\n\nFor the block averager, a good choice for the signal window is the duration of the click or call being detected, while the noise window should be at least 3 times longer. If the actual signal’s duration is variable, the signal window can be biased to the longer cases. If the difference between short and long duration signals is significant (more than 2x), another option is to create multiple bands each tuned to the different durations. The noise window shouldn’t be so long as to cause neighbouring signals to be in the noise window during detection. For example, if the real signal’s duration is 1.0 seconds and the inter-call interval (time between start of one call and the start of the next call) is 3.0 seconds a noise window of 5 seconds would be appropriate, but a noise window of 10.0 seconds would be too long. In this case the longest suggested noise window would be 5 seconds to avoid corrupting the noise estimate with other signals of interest.\nFor the decaying averager, which uses feedback to generate estimates similar to the click detector, a different strategy for selecting signal and noise windows is appropriate. The signal window can still be on the order of the duration of the vocalization of interest, though it will effectively smear out the signal if many more times than the time resolution. As a general rule of thumb, it should not be more than 4 times the time resolution. The noise window needs to be longer, especially if loud calls are occurring frequently, or the noise estimate will develop a bias due to the feedback.\n\nMinimum detection interval:\nThis parameter indicates the minimum interval between individual detections. If two or more detections occur within this configured amount of time, then they will be considedered all part of the same event, and will be considered one detection.\n\n\n\nParameter Tooltips\nMost of the target configuration parameters have legal bounds that are determined either by the audio data source’s parameters or by other target configuration parameter values. In order to ease configuration of the Likelihood Detector module, tool tips are provided in the configuration dialog. Leaving the mouse pointer over a parameter’s value in the Value column of the dialog’s target configuration window will display a tool tip indicating the valid lower and upper bounds for a parameter. The bounds displayed by the tool tip will be enforced by the editing widget for the parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Some parameters are co-dependent, for example the signal/guard band’s noise window and the signal window. To be able to enter the value you want, it may be necessary to alter a dependent parameter. The tool tips will help you with this by explaining if any parameter boundries are dependent on another parameter.\n\n\n\nEditing a Parameter\nAll of the configurable parameters for a target configuration are editable in-place within the configuration dialog. To edit a parameter, simply double-click with the left mouse button on a value in the Value column and an editing widget will appear.\nThe editing widget for a parameter will enforce the valid values on the numbers that are entered.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Some parameters are co-dependent, for example the signal/guard band’s noise window and the signal window. To be able to enter the value you want, it may be necessary to alter a dependent parameter. The tool tips will help you with this by explaining if any parameter boundries are dependent on another parameter.\n\n\n\nParameter Validation\nThe Likelihood Detector’s configuration dialog provides validation of user input. When a tool tip displays a range of valid values (see Parameter Tooltips, above) the configuration dialog will give live feedback to the operator by disallowing invalid characters and values to be entered. This feature works in conjunction with the error reporting described below.\nThe Java Validator used to implement the validation can be very literal with what it allows you to type. Here are some helpful hints to keep in mind when entering floating-point values:\n\nYou can hit the ESCAPE key at any time to cancel editing and return the parameter to its original value.\nIf you want to type a fractional number beginning with zero (e.g., 0.5), make sure you type the zero first. The validator may get confused if you type “.5”.\nSometimes deleting digits from the middle of a number creates an invalid value and the validator will attempt to correct it for you. You can always select the whole number with the mouse or the keyboard and start over.\n\n\nNote: Some parameters are co-dependent, for example the signal/guard band’s noise window and the signal window. To be able to enter the value you want, it may be necessary to alter a dependent parameter. The tool tips will help you with this by explaining if any parameter boundries are dependent on another parameter.\n\n\n\nError/Warning reporting\nWhen a new target configuration is added, or when all of the signal bands for a target configuration have been removed, the target configuration isn’t valid. Since a configuration isn’t valid without at least one signal band, the target configuration selection box will display a red border prompting you to add a signal band.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile editing a target configuration parameter, if the text entered isn’t valid or is not within the allowed legal boundries for the parameter, then the configuration dialog will display a red border around the parameter’s editor and keep the editing focus there until a valid value is entered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince many of the target configuration’s parameters have legal boundries based on audio data source parameters or on other configuration parameters, it is possible that a change to a parameter will invalidate some other parameter in a target configuration. In addition, a change to an audio data source may invalidate values in one or more whole target configurations.\nIf this condition occurs, then the existance of invalid parameter(s) will be indicated in two ways:\n\nThe background colour for the entire value box for the parameter will change to red until the parameter is adjusted.\nThe target configuration activation checkbox will change its state to inactive and will display a red border around it until the parameter is adjusted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain cases, a value can be within an accepted range, but it will produce an undesirable result. For example, the Noise Window parameter of the signal and guard bands will produce a warning if it is set to a value that is greater-than or equal to the time resolution times 500. In this case, the warning is provided to make the user aware of the increased processing load that would be required.\nWhen a warning condition is detected, the configuration dialog will change the background of that parameter to yellow:",

    "text": "Data Flow\nThe data flow begins with an audio data source (i.e., a Sound Acquisition module), and the Likelihood Detection Module requires an audio data source to be configured in order to operate. From there, raw audio data goes through several stages of processing, each with its dedicated process, before the processing stream emits detections. The stages are as follows:\n\nFFT Processing\nWhen a target configuration is created, the first thing the Likelihood Detection Module does is calculate the actual FFT parameters required based on the operator’s suggestions for the frequency and time resolutions and the audio data source’s parameters. The module will then seek an existing FFT data block within the PAMGuard system that has those parameters and is also for the same configured audio source. If a matching FFT process is not located, an FFT process is automatically created within the Likelihood Detection Module, and becomes the first step in the processing stream for the target configuration. The output of this stage of processing is a standard PAMGuard FFT data block (i.e., RecyclingDataBlock&#60FFTDataUnit&#62).\nLinear Average Spectra Processing\nThis process computes the average band energy for all of a target configuration’s bands by averaging the FFT magnitude between the start and end frequencies for that band. The output of this stage of processing is a PamDataBlock&#60AverageSpectraDataUnit&#62.\nSpectral ETI Processing\nThis process computes the average band energy for all of the bands in a target configuration by averaging the FFT magnitude between the minimum (start) and maximum (end) frequencies for the bands. The output of this stage of processing is a PamDataBlock&#60SpectralEtiDataUnit&#62.\nNormalization Processing\nThe normalizer process computes a signal and noise window estimate based on the configured normalization algorithm (i.e., either decaying average or block average) and the configured signal and window lengths. The output of this stage of processing is a PamDataBlock&#60NormalizedDataUnit&#62.\nThreshold Detection Processing\nThe detection process computes the actual likelihood ration test (LRT) portion of the detection process. This algorithm does two tests: first, for any given signal band, if the likelihood ration is greater than the user defined threshold, then a detection may be present. Second, if defined, and there may be a detection present, the detector divides the signal estimate of the signal-band by the average signal estimate af all of the associated guard bands. If that ratio is greater than the user-defined threshold, then a detection results. The output of this stage of processing is zero to many ThresholdDetectorDataUnit, which is an extension of the standard PAMGuard PamDetection&#60&#62 class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext: Adding a New Likelihood Detector Module",

These are either the output from an FFTEngine, or some other process that produces FFT / Spectrogram data. If no data sources are listed, you need to create an appropriate FFTEngine in the PAMGuard data model.\n\nChannel List and Grouping\nSelect which channels you wish to detect whistles on and which pairs or channels should be used to calculate bearings to detected whistles.\nTo do this, select the channels you wish to use using the check boxes, then assign group numbers. Only the first channel in each group will be used for detection, if a whistle is detected, then data from the second channel in the group will be used to calculate a bearing to that whistle.\nIn the example above, whistles will be detected on channels 0 and 2. Should a whistle be detected, then channel 1 or 3 will be used to calculate a bearing.\n\n\n\nPeak Detection\n\nTwo peak detectors are currently available. You are recommended to use the ‘IFAW Whistle Peak Detector’ which is the same as the peak detector on the old IFAW whistle software.\nThe first stage of the whistle detection process is to compare the instantaneous values in the spectrogram S to a measured value of background noise. The background noise N at time t and frequency f is measured using\n\nwhere the constant ? is given by ?=?t/?,\n?t being the time between successive time partitions in the spectrogram and ? is the smoothing constant set in the Peak Detection dialog. Two values of the smoothing constant are used, one when the data are below threshold which allows relatively rapid response of the system to varying noise levels and one when the data are already above threshold to avoid the presence of a whistle affecting the chances of detecting further whistles by raising the detection threshold.\nAfter background noise measurement, the total number of frequency bins in each time partition that exceed the detection threshold is counted. If this exceeds a set percentage of the total bins (Maximum bins over threshold) it is assumed that there is a broad band click and no whistle peaks are extracted from that time partitions. Otherwise, groups of bins in frequency that exceed threshold and lie between the specified minimum and maximum frequency width are used to create spectral peaks which are passed to the whistle linker.\n\n\nLinking\n\nThree parameters control whether or not peaks from different time partitions can be joined into putative whistles.\nSeveral parameters can be specified.\nMax Sweep: the maximum allowed frequency sweep rate.\nMax Sweep Differential : the rate at which the frequency sweep can change (how curved the whistle contour can be)\nMax Amplitude Change: the rate at which the peak amplitude can change along the length of the whistle.\nFor a peak to be added to the whistle, all three criteria must be satisfied (except on the very first linkage for each whistle, in which case the differential term is not used). If more than one peak is a candidate for linking to a whistle, then an overall ‘goodness of link’ value is calculated using the weight terms for each parameter.\nMax gap is the maximum number of time partitions that can be skipped at any point within a whistle with peaks still being linked.\n\n\nWhistle Selection\n\nWhistles are only created if the the linked peaks (putative whistles) pass two final tests:\nMinimum Length: Whistles must exceed some minimum length\nMinimum Occupancy: If the Max gap parameter in the Linking stage is &gt; 0, then whistles are only created if the number of peaks making up the whistle occupy a minimum percentage of the total whistle length.\n\n\nEvent Detection\nA Whistle Event occurs when the rate at which whistles are produces exceeds some minimum value. Since there is generally a low rate of false detections of individual whistles and since most whistling species produce many whistles, whistle events are often a more useful indicator of the presence of animals than individual whistles.\nIntegration Time - time to count whistles over.\nMinimum Whistle Count - minimum number of whistles required to form a whistle event\nMaximum gap - time interval after the last whistle in an event before the event is closed and counting starts again from 0.\nPrevious: Creating a new whistle detector\nNext: Whistle Detector Display",

    "text": "It is often the case that multiple whistles from different animals will overlap in time and frequency. If large groups of dolphins are encountered, then overlapping whistles tend to be the norm rather than the exception. While this may not be a problem if you are only interested in detecting whistles, if you are measuring bearings to individual whistles or if you are using the Whistle Classifier it is necessary to separate out the different sounds.\nThe Whistle and Moan detector has four options which control how overlapping whistles are handled\n\nLeave branched regions intact\nDiscard branched regions\nSeparate all branches\nRe-link across joins\n\nThis option is set at the bottom of the Whistle and Moan configuration dialog.\n\n\n\ndialog\n\n\nThe different options are illustrated below using three simulated overlapping linear chirps.\n\nLeave branched regions intact\nIf this option is selected, then branched regions will be left intact and may contain more one actual sound.\n\n\n\nDiscard branched joins\nIf this option is selected, than any region that has more than one detected frequency peak in any time slice will be discarded.\n\n\nSeparate all branches\nIf this option is selected, then all branches will be separated and passed on as individual sounds. A break is created every time the number of consecutive peaks changes. So a pair of crossing whistles will generally be broken into five parts - each of the four branches and the crossing point itself.\nIn the example below, the three sounds have been broken into 12 separate parts.\n\n\n\nRe-link across joins\nIf this option is selected, then the algorithm will attempt to rejoin individual tones across joins. First, the sound is broken up as above, it then rejoins the different components according to the following rules:\n\nIf there are the same number of sounds in consecutive time slices and each sound in the earlier slice is in contact with one in the later slice, then they are joined with 1:1 correspondence.\nA crossing point is defined as a sound which has the same number of other sounds entering it as leave it and has a total length no longer than the set maximum in the options dialog. Sounds entering and leaving a cross are linked across it with the highest frequency sound on one side joining the lowest frequency sound on the other.\nIf there is a branch (one sound splitting to two or more) or a join (two or more sounds merging into one), then the frequency gradient of the merged part is compared to that of the sounds entering or leaving and the sound with the best match is joined to the merged section. Very short sections (fewer than 10 time slices) are penalised during the comparison to favour longer whistles.\n\n\nWhich branching and joining method you chose may depend on the application. Generally, re-linking across joins is the best option for small cetacean whistles.\nPrevious: Configure the region connector",

It can also measure time delays between the arrival of sounds on different channels and use these to calculate bearings, and in some instances ranges to detected sounds.\nWhich channels the Whistle and Moan detector detects on and which channels it uses for bearing and range calculations is controlled by the channel grouping section of the options dialog.\n\nWhen a data source is selected, the dialog will show a series of check boxes, one for each channel. Select the channels you want to use for detection OR bearing calculation, then to the right of each channel check box, assign the channel to a group. The group numbers themselves are not important - they just need to be different for each group.\nThe Whistle and Moan detector will detect sounds only on the first channel in each group.\nIf a sound is detected, it will then use data from other channels in the same group to measure time delays between the arrival of the signal on the different channels. The Whistle and Moan detector will do this independently for each group.\n\nMeasuring Range\nIf more than one group is present, then if whistles which overlap in time and frequency are detected on more than one channel group, the Whistle and Moan detector will attempt to cross the bearings measured within each channel group in order to estimate a range to the sound.\nThe example above was set up to work with a hydrophone array which consisted of four hydrophones arranged in two pairs. The separation of each pair was 3m and the distance between pairs was 200m.

Increasingly, data may be grouped into ‘Events’ or ‘Super Detections’ in which case data may also be selected or coloured by the properties of those groupings. Further, PAMGuard is increasingly using annotations, for instance allowing the user to develop their own form to add information to a spectrogram mark. Again it is possible for the user to select and colour based on the content of these annotations.\nData selector and symbol chooser options are usually accessed by clicking on the display with the right mouse button and selecting the small wheel like icon on the popup menu items.\n\nAs well as being different for each type of data, PAMGuard also creates a unique data selector and symbol chooser for each display. This means that you can select one subset of data on one display, and a different type of data on another. For example, you might chose to have two map displays, one showing clicks that have been classified as harbour porpoise and another map showing beaked whales. Similarly, you might have a display of clips from the clip generator which shows all of the clips, and a second display which only shows those that have been included in a group detection.\nMore on Data Selectors\nMore on Symbol Choosers",

    "text": "The Time Display FX is a general and flexible display for displaying time based data from multiple sound processing and detection modules.\nThe display uses the Java FX graphics library which is only available if you are running Java version 8 or above (i.e. not Java 7).\nTime is always displayed along one axis of the display, the units of the other axis can vary depending on the type of data, for instance, click detector output can contain bearing, inter-click interval, amplitude or frequency information, whereas FFT output can only display frequency information.\nTypes of data which can be shown on this display are shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nPAMGuard Module\nData Type\nAxis type(s)\n\n\n\n\nFFT (Spectrogram) Engine\nFFT Data\nFrequency\n\n\nClick Detector\nClicks\nBearing; Interclick interval (ICI); Amplitude; Frequency\n\n\nWhistle and Moan Detector\nWhistle / Moan Contours\nBearing, Frequency\n\n\nSound Acquisition\nRaw Audio Data\nAmplitude\n\n\n\nData from other modules will be added in future releases\n\nConfiguring the display\nAny number of Time Displays can be created within PAMGuard User Display Panels.\nOnce a User Display Panel has been created, the option to create a “New time base display fx” will appear in the User Display menu. Select this menu option and an empty display container will appear.\n\nClick on the downward poining arrow ‘V’ in the middle near the top of the display to show the display configuration panel.\n\n\n\nGraphs and Data\nTo configure the display the user must understand the concept of “Graphs”\nA display panel can contain any number of graphs, with each one being stacked vertically in the display. All graphs within a display panel will share a common time axis and time scroll bar, however each graph can have a different data axis dimension (e.g. bearing, frequency, amplitude, etc.)\nThe data axis dimension is controlled by the type of data added to each graph.\nTo add or remove graphs, use the + and - buttons at the left end of the configuration panel\n\nAdd data to a graph by clicking on the Graph buttons in the configuration panel to show a drop down menu of available data types (if no data are available, then add some modules to your PAMGuard configuration). Data can be removed from a graph using the same menus.\n\nYou can add as many types of data to a graph as you wish and the data will be plotted on top of one another. There are no constraints as to which data are mixed within a graph, but the user should select data which can be plotted on a common axis, i.e. it’s not sensible to select one type of data which can only display frequency and another which can only display amplitude.\n\n\nAxis Dimensions\nOnce data have been added to a graph, the display will examine each type of data to see which data dimensions it supports and construct a list of possible dimensions from all types of data connected to that graph. To select the dimension of the display axis, click on the small &gt; arrow in the top left corner of a graph and a larger panel will appear showing all possible options.\n\nIn this case, the graph is showing both Spectrogram data (FFT 2kHz) and the output of a Whistle and Moan detector (Moans Contours). The Spectrogram data can show only on a Frequency axis, whereas the moans can show either on a frequency or on a bearing axis. Therefore if the frequency axis is selected, both the spectrogram AND the Moans Contours will show, however if the bearing axis is selected, then only the Moans will show.\nAlso note that the display has discovered that the FFT data is multi-channel (channels 0 and 7 in this case) and additional options have been provided to display only certain channels of data. Different channels are displayed within separate display strips within each graph.\n\n\nScrolling\n When running in real time mode, the display can operate in “Scroll” or “Wrap” mode. Toggle between the two modes using the button with left / right arrows in the configuration panel. Scrolling often looks nicer, but if you’re trying to mark data in real time, wrapping can often be easier since things are moving around less.\n\n\nData Marking\n To mark data on the display, select the “Allow marking” button in the configuration panel. To make and use data marking, you will also need to correctly configure the relationship between the display and marked data and will have to hold down the Ctrl while making marks. For more information see Display Marking. The display will pause while marks are being drawn.\n\n\nData Display Options\nMany types of data have a number of options controlling how they are displayed, for instance the colour used for symbols, amplitude ranges of spectrograms, etc.\nConfiguration panels for individual data types are available by clicking on the settings button in the top right corner of each graph. The example below shows settings panels for a graph showing Spectrogram and Whistle and Moan Detector data. For the spectrogram, the user can select the frequency range to display and the amplitude colour and scale. For the ‘moans’ it is possible to select a symbol type and colour.",

See below for details of acceptable sources.\nFrom the Settings menu, select “Bearing Calculator settings”. This will open up a new dialog containing 3 tabs: Source, Channel Groups and Algorithms.\n\n\n\nSource tab\n\n\nDetection Source: Which module triggers the Bearing Calculator. Many different detector modules can be used, including Click Detector, Whistle and Moan Detector, Spectrogram Annotation Marks, etc.\nData Source: Where the Bearing Calculator actually gets it’s data from. If the Detection Source already has suitable acoustic data with which to perform calculations, such as the Click Detector or Whistle & Moan Detector, this drop-down menu is disabled and the Detection Source is used for the Data Source (see image above right). If the Detection Source does not contain data, such as a Spectrogram Mark, the data source needs to be selected here (see image above left). The Data Source can be raw audio data or FFT data.\nFFT Parameters: If the Data Source is raw audio data, the FFT parameters to use for bearing calculations should be specified here. If the Data Source is already FFT data, the information here is for reference only and cannot be modified.\n\n\n\nChannel Grouping tab\n\nIf the Data Source on the Source tab already has channel grouping definitions (such as an FFT Module, Whistle & Moan Detector, Click Detector, etc), the channel grouping from that source is used here and cannot be modified (see image above right). If the Data Source does not define channel groups (such as Raw Audio Data), the grouping must be done here (see image above left).\n\nChannel Group Type: Select how the channels should be grouped, either No Grouping, a Single Group, or multiple (User) Groups.\nChannel Grouping: When a data source is selected, the dialog will show a series of check boxes - one for each channel available from that Source. Select the channels you want to use for bearing calculation, then to the right of each channel check box, assign the channel to a group. The group numbers themselves are not important - they just need to be different for each group.\nThe bearing algorithm will combine the information from all channels in a group and output the resulting signal. If there are multiple groups defined, there will be multiple output signals. In such a case, each signal will be identified by the group number.\nIn the above left image 2 groups have been defined, each with 4 channels.\nIf a detection is made in a single group, the channels in that group are used for bearing calculations and there is one set of output data. If this checkbox is selected, then bearings will be calculated for ALL groups when there is a detection in one of them. The timing information from the group with the detection is used for the groups without a detection, in order to calculate the bearing data.\nCare should be taken when selecting this option. If the hydrophone spacing is large between groups, the timing information from the group with the detection may not be applicable to the other groups. It is possible that the signal of interest would be missed, and resultant bearing data incorrect.\n\n\n\nAlgorithms tab\n\nThe user is able to select a beamformer algorithm for each group defined on the Channel Groups tab. The window displays the group number, and the number of channels associated with that group.\n\nAlgorithm: specify which algorithm to use for this group. There are 3 types of algorithms available: Basic Frequency Domain beamformer, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response beamformer (MVDR), and Time Of Arrival Difference (TOAD).\n\nThe Basic Frequency Domain beamformer algorithm combines the signals from multiple channels into a single output using a static set of weights.\nThe MVDR also combines the signals from multiple channels into a single output, but uses an adaptive weighting scheme which seeks to minimize the variance of the input signal. The MVDR is more processor-intensive, but may result in better noise reduction and signal amplification.\nTOAD seeks to calculate bearings based on the difference in detection time between pairs of hydrophones. It is the technique used internally by the Whistle & Moan Detector module to calculate bearings to whistles.\n\nSettings: press the settings button to open up the settings for the algorithm in a new dialog.\n\nPrevious: Bearing Calculator Overview\nNext: Configuring the Algorithms",

    "text": "Configuring the Directional Audio\n\nRequired PAMGuard modules\nThe following modules are required for DIFAR Localisation.\n\nSound Acquisition: Recording data from a VHF radio receiver at a sample rate of 48kHz.\nNMEA, GPS. These module are required if you wish to use the Directional Audio module to reduce noise from the direction of the GPS (e.g. noise from the research vessel)\n\n\n\nRecommended Modules\nThe following modules are not required, but are highly recommened to facilitate analysis of DIFAR data.\n\nDIFAR Localisation: Contains a Sonobuoy Manager for easy tracking of metadata when deploying sonobuoys\nAdditional FFT (Spectrogram) Engine view the spectrum of the directional audio.\n\n\n\nSettings\nThe configuration for the Directional Audio are accessed via the Settings menu.\n\nThe Data Source must contain multiplexed audio from a DIFAR sonobuoy, including pilot tones at 7500 and 15000 Hz. The Directional audio module requires 24 kHz of audio bandwidth from the raw audio source (48 kHz minimum sample rate). An typical data source would be an Analog-Digital converter or sound card that is connected to the audio output of one or many VHF radio receivers.\nThe output sample rate of the directional audio is presently fixed at 8000 Hz, but can be resampled with a Decimator module.\nIf the option Use GPS data source for noise reduction is checked, then the Directional Audio module will attempt to adjust the listening direction in the opposite direction of the GPS data. Presently only GPS sources are available for noise reduction, but AIS sources, and possibly DIFAR localisations may also be available as Noise Cancellation locations in future releases.\n\n\nUsage\n\nNoise reduction\nThe Directional Audio module can be used to preferentially listen to audio from a particular direction, while attenuating audio from the opposite direction.\nThis module requires audio from a DIFAR sonobuoy and will output directional audio by using a beamforming algorithm. This module makes use of the AMMC DIFAR demodulator, and beamforming algorithm is that described in Equation 1 from Thode et al (2016). This module can use a GPS data stream to automatically set the listening direction in order to potentially reduce masking noise in the direciton of the GPS data source.\nWhen using GPS data for noise cancellation, the listening direction (steering angle of the beamformer) will automatically be set in the opposite direction of the GPS data source. The module uses the location of the current HydrophoneStreamer as the location of the sonobuoy. The Heading of the streamer is used to apply an additional Compass Correction to the angle between the Sonobuoy and GPS data.\nAs described by Thode et al (2016) steering the null of the beam towards the GPS bearing will attenuate sounds originating from that direction. The expected performance and limitations are described in detail by Thode et al, but in short, noise reduction typically applies to an entire quadrant (90 degree span of bearings, 45 degrees on either side of the null angle).\nAt present, this feature may be useful for detecting whales using DIFAR sonobuoys that have been deployed from a noisy vessel.\n\n\nDirectional Listening\nIf not using the GPS data for noise reduction, then the direction of listening can be adjusted manually by typing preferred listening angle into the Side Panel. The new listening direction will come into effect after hitting enter\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nThode, AM, KH Kim, RG Norman, SB Blackwell and CR Greene 2016.

    "text": "In addition to providing a magnetic bearing to the source of acoustic detections, the DIFAR module provides a means to �calibrate� the compass of the sonobuoy in order to account for local magnetic anomaly and the magnetic deviation inherent in the compass within the sonobuoy. After �calibration� the DIFAR module will report all bearings referenced to true north. The procedure for �calibrating� the compass is the same as that presented in detail by (Miller 2012, Miller et al. 2013, Miller, Collins, et al. 2014), and basically involves measuring several magnetic bearings to the known positions of the research vessel as it moves away from a sonobuoy after deployment.\nTo start a calibration run, press the �Start Calib�� button at the top of the DIFAR queue display. If more than one buoy is deployed, then a drop down menu will appear allowing to select a single buoy. When you start a calibration, a window will appear showing two histograms. The top histogram shows uncorrected (Magnetic) bearings from the buoy, the bottom histogram shows the bearing correction required to line each clip up directly on the vessel.\n\n\n\nCalibration window\n\n\nNaturally there will be some scatter about the true value and there may be some values which are completely incorrect. The operator can right click with the mouse on the lower histogram to select the mean or the modal (most common) value. They can also drag the red line to the required position using the mouse.\nPressing Cancel will abort the calibration run.\nWhen the operator presses OK, a small option dialog will appear asking them to confirm that they wish to update the buoy heading. The updated heading data will then be stored with the PAMGuard Array Manager.\nIt is possible to simultaneously calibrate more than one buoy at a time.\nIf calibration of a sonobuoy in this manner is not feasible, compass corrections may be entered manually (e.g. using magnetic anomaly from a chart) as the Heading in the Streamer Dialog of the Array Manager. The Use Orientation Data checkbox should be checked.\n\n\n\nCalibration window\n\n\nPrevious: Crossing Bearings\nNext: Graphics Output",

    "text": "The DIFAR localisation system is configured either from an item in the main Detection menu or by pressing the Settings button at the top of the DIFAR queue panel. Process Settings are laid out across a few different tabs on the dialog. Generally, you will only have to set up the Data and Species tabs and can leave other settings at their default values.\nData and buffers\nProcessing (Classification/Species)\nCalibration\nAutomation\n\n\nData and buffers\n\n\n\nData sources and buffers\n\n\nData Source determines which audio source will be used to when de-multiplexing DIFAR clips. This is generally the sound acquisition module connected to a sound card receiving multiplexed audio data from a VHF radio receiver.\nDemultiplexing Settings determines which demultiplexor (demodulator) will be used.\nMost DIFAR sonobuoys send data via VHF radio link back to an aircraft of nearby vessel. Consequently, the acoustic data from the three sensors are multiplexed into a single signal prior to transmission. An important part of the processing is therefore the de-multiplexing of the signal back into it�s three separate components, and to achieve this, PAMGuard makes use of a software library developed by Greenridge Sciences Inc. Greeneridge Sciences Demultiplexing Library is not included with PAMGuard and must be purchased separately. Upon purchase, you be supplied with a file GreenridgeDemux32.dll or GreenridgeDemux64.dll, and this should be placed in your Program Files (x86)/PAMGuardBeata/lib folder prior to launching PAMGuard.\nAn alternative to the Greenridge demultiplexor is the Australian Marine Mammal Centre (AMMC) Experimental Demultiplexor. This freely available, open source demodulator developed at the Australian Antarctic Division is included in PAMGuard within the DIFAR module. The AMMC Experimental Demodulator does not require purchase, and at the time of writing (July 2014) is not subject to export restrictions by the Australian Defence Control Export Agency. However, the AMMC module is considered Beta software and may not be as stable, reliable, or robust as the Greeneridge Demodulator.\nThe Greenridge demultiplexor is more robust and well tested, but must be purchased separately. The AMMC Expermintal demultiplexer is included by default.\n\n\nBuffers\nPrepend to clip: This is the amount of data (in seconds) added to the start of each DIFAR clip. When using the Greeneridge demodulator, this should be set to approximately 3 s or more to enable the phased lock loop in the DIFAR de-multiplexing module to lock onto the carrier signal. When using the AMMC demodulator, this should be set to 0.\nTime to keep Raw Data: The time in seconds that raw data are held in memory. Once data are discarded it is no longer possible to make clips from the data for DIFAR processing. Generally a couple of minutes is adequate. Increasing this too much can cause PAMGuard to run out of memory.\nQueued Data Buffer (m): The minimum number of minutes that data are held in the queue prior to processing before being automatically discarded. Additionally, there are also controls on the DIFAR Queue Display to determine how long data are kept in the queue.\nProcessed Data Buffer (m): The number of minutes that processed data are held prior to being discarded. Additionally, the Map Data Selector can determine how long processed data are kept.\nClear queued data at start: If this is selected, then each time PAMGuard starts, all queued data clips will be discarded.\nClear processed data at start: If this is selected, then each time PAMGuard starts, processed data objects will be discarded, and thus removed from the map.\n\n\n\nClassification (Species) Processing\n\n\n\ndifarParamsDialog_Clips\n\n\nThe PAMGuard DIFAR module uses the beamforming algorithms as described by (D�Spain 1994, McDonald 2004) to obtain an estimate of the signal power as a function of tonal frequency and magnetic bearing. We refer to the display of signal power as a function of frequency and bearing as the DIFARGram. For a given detection, the bearing and frequency with the highest power can usually be said to represent the direction of the vocalisation.\nParameters for creating the DIFARGram are controlled on this tab. The PAMGuard DIFAR module allows for a different DIFARGram parameters to be used for different “Species” (i.e. user-defined classifications) of vocalisations. The Edit Species List button allows the creation of new user-defined species classifications. The Select Species drop-down menu is used to select a species in order to edit itparameters.\n\nDIFARGram parameters\nDIFAR calculation allows selection of the beamforming method: either Bartlett or MVDR.\nSample Rate: After de-multiplexing, the data for each clip are decimated to a lower sample rate.\nFFT Length: The Fourier Transform length to use during DIFAR processing and display. This must be a power of 2.\nFFT Hop: The hop, in samples between successive FFT frames.\nNo. Angle Bins determines the angular precision when computing the DIFARGram. Generally, 360 bins, for a 1 degree resolution is adequate. Increasing higher than 360 degrees may substantially increase processing times.\nIntensity Scale is a numeric factor that controls the color scaling (i.e. contrast) of the DIFARGram. Specifically, a “floor” value is set for the DIFARGram that is equal to the maximum power in the DIFARGram divided by the Intensity Scale. Intensity Scale values between 10 and 10000 provide adequate contrast for most DIFAR data.\nBeamforming Frequency Max. and Beamforming Frequency Min. Maximum and Minimum frequencies to use to use when determining the bearings of a DIFAR localisation. For detections that were manually marked on the spectrogram, these values are overridden if the �Marked� button is selected, in which case the frequency limits of the mark made by the operator will be used. For automatic detections, the values will be overridden if the �Detection� button is pressed.\nLoad/Save List. These buttons can be used to save or load your list of classifications so that these lists can be easily shared and transferred among different settings files.\n\n\n\n\nCalibration\n\n\n\nCalibration panel\n\n\n\nIntensity calibration (sonobuoy frequency response)\nMost sonobuoys have a non-flat frequency response i.e. the intensity is shaped as a function of frequency in order to optimise the dynamic range of the FM signals sent across the limited bandwidth of the VHF radio link. The effects of this “pre-whitening” filter must be reversed in order to make calibrated intensity measurements from signals from sonobuoys.\nIn addtion to the frequency response of the sonobuoy, the frequency response of the VHF receiver must also be taken into account when measuring intensity of signals from sonobuoys that have been received over VHF radio. The View/Edit Frequency Response button can be used to create a single arbitrary FIR filter that will correct for the combined frequency response of the sonobuoy and the VHF receiver. Lastly, to ensure accuracy, make sure that the hydrophone sensitivity in the Array Manager is set to the correct reference sensitivity for each sonobuoy.\nExample: A DIFAR 53D sonobuoy is used with a WiNRADiO G39 sonobuoy VHF receiver.\nThe frequency response of the 53D sonobuoy (figure below) is given relative to the reference pressure (100Hz) and reference intensity (122 dB re 1 uPa RMS; as per Greene et al 2004).\n\nIntensity frequency response of a DIFAR 53D Sonobuoy (adapted from Greene et al 2004)\nThe hydrophone sensitivity is measured in dB re 1 V/uPa. Therefore the inverse of the reference intensity can be used as the sensitivity of the hydrophone in the Array Manager (Figure Below).\n\nSetting the hydrophone sensitivity in PAMGuard’s Array Manager\nAt the reference pressure and intensity the sonobuoy will generate a 25 kHz of frequency deviation. The voltage frequency response of the WiNRADiO G39 receiver is then measured at 25 kHz frequency deviation and found to be relatively flat at 1 V (i.e. 0 dB from 10 to 48000 Hz). These two frequency responses are combined and entered into the DIFAR module using the button View/Edit Freq. Response (Figure Below).\n\nSetting up a filter for obtaining calibrated intensity measurements from sonobuoys\nThe DIFAR module will now apply this filter to the data from the omnidirectional hydrophone when measuring the intensity (i.e. processing) of an audio clip. The resulting intensity measurements will be accurately referenced to 1 uPa RMS. NB: Specifications from sonobuoy manufacturers typically suggest that intensity is accurate to within �3 dB.\nCalibration GPS Source\nIf multiple GPS modules have been added to PAMGuard (e.g. in viewer mode or mixed-mode for post-processing of data), then this drop-down menu can be used to select the GPS module that contains the position of the calibration sound source.\n\n\nCompass calibration\nIn addition to providing a magnetic bearing to the source of acoustic detections, the DIFAR module provides a means to �calibrate� the compass of the sonobuoy in order to account for local magnetic anomaly and the magnetic deviation inherent in the compass within the sonobuoy. After �calibration� the DIFAR module will report all bearings referenced to true north. The procedure for �calibrating� the compass is the same as that presented in detail by (Miller 2012, Miller et al. 2013, Miller, Collins, et al. 2014), and basically involves measuring several magnetic bearings to the known positions of a research vessel as it moves away from a sonobuoy after deployment. See here for details of running the calibration.\nAudio clips used for calibration, are treated as a special species and are processed and localised in much the same way as other species. The DIFARGram parameters for calibration clips are controlled using the top portion of this tab. The bottom portion of the tab can be used to set the length and number of clips to include in a calibration run.\nClip length (s): Length of each automatically generated calibration clip.\nInterval between clips(s): The number of seconds between automatically generated calibration clips.\nNumber of clips in sequence: The number of clips to include in the calibration run.\nAuto-process vessel clips: When checked, automatically generated calibration clips will be automatically moved from the DIFAR queue to the DIFAR processing module as soon as the previous clip is cleared from the DIFAR processing module.\n\n\n\n\nAutomation\n\n\n\ndifarParamsDialog_Automation\n\n\nThe main purpose of the DIFAR Localisation module is to process signals from directional DIFAR sonobuoys in order to obtain bearings to vocalisations from whales. The detection of whale vocalisations may take place automatically via any PAMGuard detector that can generate clips (e.g Ishmael energy and spectrogram detectors, PAMGuard�s whistle and moan detectors) or can take place via manual selection of calls on the spectrogram. Any number of these automated detectors can be used to present detections to the DIFAR module.\nAutomated Detectors: This panel lists all of the PAMGuard modules that are capable of generating detections that can be processed and potentially localised with the DIFAR Localisation module. The first column lists the name of the detector, and the checkbox in the second column determines whether or not the detections will be used by the DIFAR Locasitaion module. Be warned though that many detectors produce false alarms at a high rate which may fill the DIFAR queue very rapidly. The final column labelled “Classification” contains a drop-down menu containing all of the “Classifications” known to the DIFAR module. Selection of a classification species will force all of the detections for that detector to be classified and automatically processed accordingly. Automatic detection without automatic processing can be achieved by selecting the “Unclassified” species (i.e. listed first in the “Classification” drop-down menu).\nQuick classification: This panel controls which classifications, if any, will be prominently visible next to each detection in the DIFAR Queue. There can be up to three �Favourite� species which will appear as buttons next to each clip in the DIFAR queue. NB: Species that are not “Favourites” will be available via a drop-down menu next to each clip.\nAuto Saving (and auto-processing)\nAuto-process classified clips: When this box is checked, clips that have a classification will be automatically processed (i.e. DIFARGrams will be created and displayed). If not checked, then the user must click on the Process button next to each clip in the DIFAR queue to process each clip.\nAuto save processed clips: If you select to Auto save processed data, then once a DIFAR clip has been processed it will automatically be saved after the set delay time using the maximum DIFAR angle and automatically crossing bearings to other detections if more than one buoy is in operation.\nGlobal Keyboard Shortcuts:\nKeyboard shortcuts can be assigned to any or all of the five actions listed under this panel. If any of these keys are pressed in any PAMGuard window (including, but not limited to windows created by the DIFAR module) their corresponding actions will be carried out if possible. Three of these actions, Save, Save without Crossbearing, and Delete have corresponding buttons on the DIFARGram. The remaining two actions will change the selected classification in the DIFAR Selection sidebar.\n\n\nAdvanced\nUse DifarGram summary line: When checked the angle with the maximum value of the summary line in the DifarGram will be automatically selected for newly processed bearings. When unchecked, the angle and frequency with that contain the maximum value of the DIFARGram will be selected for newly processed bearings.\nPrevious: Configuring the User Display\nNext: Running the DIFAR System",

    "section": "Tracked Groups",
    "text": "Tracked Groups\nGroups is a feature that allows the operator to semi-automatically assign a text label to bearings that are believed to originate from a closely spaced group of calling whales. Summary statistics for each group are then calculated and can be plotted on the PAMGuard Map. The Groups panel on the DifarGram is used to manage and view the list of Groups as well as assign groups to DIFAR clips.\n\n\n\nPAMGuard Map with Tracked Groups\n\n\n\nAdding and removing groups\nGroups can be created and removed using the buttons. The Add group button will create a dialog-window that asks the user to type the name of a new group, and upon accepting the dialog-window the name of the new group is added to the list-box in the Groups panel. The Remove group button removes the currently-selected group’s label from the list-box. When a group is removed from the list-box, new bearings cannot be assigned to that group, however the PAMGuard database and map will retain the entry for that group. Groups that have been removed can be re-added to the list-box using the Add group button and typing the name of a previously removed group. NB: Group names are case sensitive, so “Apple” and “apple” are considered two different groups. The default group “No group” is always present in the list-box and cannot be removed. Summary statistics for the default group are not plotted on the map.\n\n\nAssigning Groups\nAssigning a group to a DIFAR clip involves selecting name of the group in the Groups panel before saving the clip. The selected/highlighted group will be assigned to the DIFAR clip when the clip is saved. The Groups module will then calculate a summary of the bearings from all of the DIFAR clips from that sonobuoy that were assigned to that group. Summary statistics include the mean and standard deviation of bearings to that group, the first and last bearings and detection times, and the total number of DIFAR clips assigned to that group. All summary statistics are calculated per-sonobuoy.\nAfter the first clip has been assigned to a group, PAMGuard will suggest that DIFAR clips with closely matching bearings be assigned to that group. When new clips appear in the DifarGram, the group with the closest-matching mean-bearing will be automatically highlighted. PAMGuard will only suggest groups that match closely to the bearing selected in the DifarGram. If the closest-matching mean-bearing is more than 10 degrees from that of the clip, then the default group will be selected (i.e. PAMGuard will not attempt to creat new groups, but the user should feel free to do so). NB: Because summary statistics are created for each group per-sonobuoy, automatic suggestions for a group will not work on newly deployed sonobuoys until at least one DIFAR clip has been assigned to that group on that sonobuoy.\n\n\nViewing Summary Statistics\n\n\n\nDifarGram with Controls for Tracking Groups\n\n\nTracked groups can be displayed on the PAMGuard Map in the same way as other detections (i.e. by right clicking on the map and selecting DIFAR Tracked Groups from the popup-menu). Tracked groups are shown on the map as semi-transparent wedges originating from each sonobuoy. The wedges are centred on the mean-bearing for that group, and the width of the wedges is four standard-deviations (two standard deviations anticlockwise from the mean-bearing, and two standard deviations clockwise from the mean-bearing). Hovering the mouse over the broad end of the wedge will popup the summary statistics for that group and that sonobuoy. Hovering the mouse over the name of the Group in the list-box on the DifarGram will display the summary statistics for all of the sonobuoys on which that group was detected.\nPrevious: Using the DIFARGram Display\nNext: Calibration",

The implementation of this demultiplexing software is fundamentally different than that of Greenridge Sciences Inc. It has worked well in the limited testing that has been conducted, and it appears to give similar results to those from the Greenridge Sciencies demultiplexer.\nTo the best of my knowledge, the Greenridge Sciences demultiplexing library used by PAMGuard is based on algorthims and computer-code that has been used successfully over the past 10 years (at the very least) to analyse DIFAR data. Thus, it is recommended over the AMMC demultiplexer, which should work, but has not yet seen extensive use."

    "text": "Overview\nThe general process for post-processing DIFAR recordings is somewhat more convoluted than real-time acquisition, as data must be imported in Viewer mode, but analysed in Mixed-mode. It is assumed that the user has recordings from one or more DIFAR sonobuoys, recorded at a level and sample rate suitable for recovering the directional signals (e.g. the audio was not clipped during recording and the sample rate is at least 48 kHz). The purpose of post-processing such data is to obtain magnetic and/or true bearings to sound sources audible within these recordings.\nThe general procedure for post-processing data is to first configure the hydrophone array, then import the sonobuoy deployments as streamers in VIEWER mode. Ships tracks, if available can also be imported into Viewer mode. After import of sonobuoy deployments and ships tracks the DIFAR module and required sound-processing must be configured, and this can be done either in Viewer or Mixed-mode. Finally, acoustic data can be post-processed to obtain DIFAR bearings by running PAMGuard in Mixed-mode.\nAt this point it is wise to make a backup copy of your data/ existing PAMGuard databases before any post-processing, since post-processing may alter tables, rows, and columns of the PAMGuard database."

However, the more likely scenario is that there is no PAMGuard database, so one must be created. An easy way to create a new database is to simply create a copy of a blank database (e.g. the one distributed with this tutorial).\ncopy blank.mdb difarTutorial.mdb\nWith the blank database created, run PAMGuard in Viewer-mode, and select difarTutorial.mdb as the database."

    "section": "Hydrophone array configuration",
    "text": "Hydrophone array configuration\nBefore importing any GPS or sonobuoy deployment data, the hydrophone array must be configured using PAMGuard�s Array Manager, either in Normal, Mixed, or Viewer-Mode.\n\nPresently, it is up to the user to correctly configure the streamers, hydrophones, and channel mappings within the Array Manager in a way that is sensible for DIFAR post-processing. Thus, some explanation of how the DIFAR module maps sonobuoy deployments to Hydrophone Elements and Hydrophone Streamers within the Array Manager is required. The total number of streamers and elements defined in the Array Manager must be equal to or greater than the total number of simultaneously recorded sonobuoys in the dataset. The DIFAR module assumes that each physical DIFAR sonobuoy that is deployed will have a single hydrophone element, and thus correspond to a single audio channel. In short, a one-to-one-to-one relationship is expected between the audio channel:hydrophone element:streamer.\n\nExample: single sonobuoy deployment\nFor a single sonobuoy deployment there will be one audio channel, and thus only one streamer and element is required. Configure that hydrophone element (i.e. id# 0) as follows:\nStreamer: Streamer 0\nHydrophone type: DIFAR\nHydrophone sensitivity: -122\nInterpolation: Use the location for the time preceeding each data unit\nThe other fields are not required, however if it is useful for your own purposes you can enter the deployment depth of the sonobuoy as the depth coordinate. The screenshot below shows a correctly configured hydrophone.\n\nNB: Assuming that the gain on the Analog-to-Digital Converter has been correctly set in PAMGuard, a value of -122 dB for the hydrophone sensitivity will get the spectrogram in the right ballpark of actual received levels, at least for DIFAR 53D sonobuoys received on a WinRadio G39 receivers and that have a roughly flat frequency response of 1 V audio output at 25 kHz frequency deviation. ICOM receivers (which have been commonly used on several past surveys) will have a different frequency response. The received levels won’t take into account the pre-whitening filter built in each sonobuoy (i.e highpass filter from 10-100 Hz, and from 100-1000 Hz, so received levels under 100 Hz will be displayed as lower than they really are, and received levels for signals over 100 Hz will display higher, and 100 Hz will be just about right.\nNext configure the streamer for this hydrophone by clicking on Streamer 0, and then clicking the edit button below. Most of the details for the streamer are not important at this point, as they will be overwritten in the next step when we Import the sonobuoy deployments. However, I have always set the following at this point:\nReference Position: Fixed location (moorings and buoys)\nHydrophone Locator Method to: Straight / Rigid Streamer\nInterpolation: Use the location for the time preceeding each data unit\n\nIf you have multiple datasets, or are planning on re-analysing data more than once, then you might want to Export the array to save yourself from having to follow the above steps for each data set. Click the Export button and name the array SingleSonobuoyArray.paf. Then the next time that you post-process the data, you can simply import SingleSonobuoyArray.paf instead of manually configuring the array by following the above steps.\nIf your data set only ever contains one-channel audio (i.e. recordings from only one sonobuoy at a time), then you can continue onto the section on Importing sonobuoy deployments as streamers. Otherwise continue with the example below.\n\n\nExample: Recordings with two sonobuoys\nIf your data contain simultaneous recordings from two sonobuoys (i.e. two channel audio), then add another streamer and another hydrophone and repeat the configuration steps for each of these as per the single-sonobuoy example above. When configuring hydrophone id: 1 be sure to assign it to Streamer 1 in order to maintain a 1:1:1 mapping between channels, hydrophones, and streamers.\nIf you have multiple datasets, or are planning on re-analysing data more than once, then you might want to Export the array to save yourself from having to follow the above steps for each data set. Click the Export button and name the array TwoSonobuoyArray.paf. Then the next time that you post-process the data, you can simply import TwoSonobuoyArray.paf instead of manually configuring the array by following the above steps. The screenshot below shows a properly configured two-sonobuoy array."

    "text": "Sonobuoy deployments � Import Streamer Data\nIn order to plot the correct location of sonobuoys and DIFAR bearings on the PAMGuard map, one must first input the deployment time and location of each sonobuoy. This is achieved via Settings -&gt; Hydrophone Array -&gt; Import Streamer Data …\n\nThe trick to post-processing DIFAR data is to first import the sonobuoy deployments as streamers in VIEWER mode. Streamers can be imported as a CSV file. The CSV file should NOT have a header, as the CSV import can only cope with numbers (even for the StreamerName). The format for each row in the CSV file should be:\nStreamerName, StreamerID, Origin, Locator, Time, XPos, YPos, ZPos, XErr, YErr, ZErr, Heading, Pitch, Roll, Latitude, Longitude\nWhere:\n� StreamerIndex must be equal to an existing streamer ID (i.e. one that has already been added to the Array Manager; e.g. 0 for a single sonobuoy array, 0, or 1 for a two-sonobuoy array. The streamer index is effectively the channel mapping, since we have made sure to maintain a 1:1:1 relationship between channels, hydrophones, and streamers when configuring the array (see section above).\n� Origin can either be 0 or 1 for Ship GPS or Static origins.\n� Locator can either be 0 or 1 for threading or straight/rigid locators.\n� Time should be an Excel date-number. This can be achieved by typing a date and time into a cell in MS Excel and hitting , then change the format of that cell to Number.\n� X,Y,ZPos and X,Y,ZErr should be specified in metres.\n� Heading, Pitch and Roll should be in degrees. If the DIFAR compass correction is known, enter it into the Heading column. Pitch and Roll should probably be left null (as in the example below).\n� Latitude and Longitude should be in decimal degrees with negative Latitudes for the Southern Hemisphere.\nHere is an example of eleven deployments from the 2013 Antarctic Blue Whale Voyage. Note that the deployments on StreamerID 0 cannot by definition overlap in time with other deployments on StreamerID 0, so the deployment of the next streamer on a channel marks both the end of the previous deployment and the start of the new deployment. Deployments on streamerID 0 can quite happily overlap in time with deployments on StreamerID 1. Note that sonobuoy 59 was a failure, as it has neither a precise lat/long, nor Heading (i.e. compass correction), and another sonobuoy was deployed on StreamerID1 (i.e. channel 1) almost immediately afterwards (i.e. &lt; 1/100th of a day).\nThe entries below can be used as a template for your own data: simply change the first colum to your sonobuoy deployment number, the second column to the correct data channel/streamerID, the 5th column to your deployment time, the 12th column to your compass correction (or 0 or null if not known), and lastly change the last two columns to your latitude,longitude. When you are finished entering your sonobuoy deployments save the file as a .csv file.\n52,0,1,1,41312.65103,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.4,,,-62.53047,141.00856\n53,1,1,1,41312.75039,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.9,,,-62.54945,141.70648\n54,0,1,1,41312.78403,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.5,,,-62.48229,141.97649\n55,1,1,1,41312.83917,0,0,0,0,0,0,44.6,,,-62.31181,142.28328\n56,0,1,1,41313.03021,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.5,,,-62.45373,142.58243\n57,1,1,1,41313.06223,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.4,,,-62.5171,142.86876\n58,0,1,1,41313.11081,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.4,,,-62.49822,143.25349\n59,1,1,1,41313.14236,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,-62,143\n60,1,1,1,41313.15221,0,0,0,0,0,0,48.4,,,-62.57063,143.5453\n61,0,1,1,41313.21843,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.4,,,-62.45458,143.90166\n62,0,1,1,41313.37924,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.2,,,-62.73215,143.92734\nSelect your .csv file containing sonobuoy deployments via the Browse button on the Streamer Import Dialog, and Then click Ok.\n\nNB: After importing streamers, it is recommended that you avoid using the Array Manager, as this could potentially modify the imported streamers and will almost certainly introduce bugs or undesired behaviours in PAMGuard.\n\nValidating Streamer Import\nOnce imported a summary of the streamer data should appear in the Data Map in Viewer mode.\n\nThe time-slider on the Data Map in Viewer-mode can be used to further verify that the times of the sonobuoys are correct/sensible.\nAdditionally, adding a Map module should show the deployment locations on the PAMGuard Map (ensure that the Array Manager, Streamer Data option is checked, both by right clicking on the map and using the list, and by going to Plot Overlay Options).\n\nThe time-slider on the Map in Viewer-mode can be used to further verify not only that the times of the sonobuoys are correct/sensible, but that the locations are also sensible. You will most likely need to zoom and pan to the correct location of your deployments. Additionally, you will probably need to adjust the time window (via the button with a black downward pointing triangle) in order to scroll through multiple days of data.\n\nAdditionally, for two sonobuoy arrays, the map option to color the hydrophones by channel is very useful. This can be set by right-clicking on the Map -&gt; Map Options…\n\n\nIf the positions aren�t correct, or seem suspicious, then exit, re-load from your backup database, fix the CSV file, and try again."

Again, scrolling the time slider on the Map to see that the ships track and sonobuoy deployments line up provides a good reality check to ensure that the data are at least plausible.\n\n\n\nCleanup after import\nThe GPS Import can result in an MS Access database that has an excessive file size. This provides a good excuse to create a backup of the database now that the GPS track and Sonobuoy Deployment locations have been imported.\nClose PAMGuard Viewer, open the database in MS Access, and save the database as a new MS Access database: e.g. difarTutorial-Imported.mdb.\n\nAlso, at this point it will be useful to make a backup of this file to use as a starting point for future post-processing sessions. It may be good to keep this backup in a place where it cannot be confused with the working copy (e.g. another folder) since a database file is modified each-time it is loaded into PAMGuard."

For example: The Peak-Peak Voltage of the Fireface UFX recorder used for the 2013 Antarctic Blue Whale Voyage was 8.396 V for the �Instrument� input with the gain was set to 20 dB. Thus one could enter either of the following which should be equivalent:\nPeak-Peak voltage range:8.396, Preamplifier gain:0 (tried and tested) or\nPeak-Peak voltage range:83.96, Preamplifier gain:20 (untested; should be equivalent).\n\nUnder the Offline Files tab, make sure the box Use offline files is checked and once again select the folder containing the DIFAR acoustic files.\n\nAs with the sonobuoy deployments and ships tracks, these data should now be added to the Data Map under the Sound Acquisition.\n\nThis concludes the preparation and import of metadata.

Add the spectrogram engine:\nFile -&gt; Add Modules … -&gt; Sound Processing -&gt; FFT (Spectrogram) Engine\nLike the Decimators, it is useful to give this FFT (Spectrogram) Engine a more descriptive name since there may ultimately be several of these modules. Since we will configure this FFT engine to use data from the 250 Hz decimator, it will be called Low Frequency FFT (Spectrogram) Engine. Now it needs to be configured.

Using the Decimator to reduce the sample rate to 250 Hz before taking the FFT can help achieve the desired balance between time resolution and frequency resolution, and additionally it substantially reduces computational requirements (compared to those required for comparable time-frequency resolution on a signal sampled at 48 kHz). Of course feel free to use any settings that suit your application.\n\n\nFull bandwidth spectrogram (for DIFAR diagnostics)\nIn addition to visualising the acoustic data from the omnidirectional hydrophone, viewing the full bandwidth spectrum (and spectrogram) can provide valuable diagnostic information regarding the VHF reception and correct function of the DIFAR recording chain.

Ok.\nA spectrogram display should now be visible in the Difar Display tab. NB: The Difar Display will appear in the Data Model, but will not appear to be connected to anything � this is no cause for concern: User Displays never appear connected to anything in the Data Model.\nAt this point it is wise to make a backup copy of your data/ existing PAMGuard databases before any post-processing, since post-processing may alter tables, rows, and columns of the PAMGuard database.\nBefore further configuration, it may be useful to run through the data while viewing the spectrogram in order to test that the spectrogram parameters are reasonable. Additionally, the Full Bandwidth FFT plug in will give a good indication of whether the data are suitable for further DIFAR processing.\nClick the big red circle to run through the data in Mixed-Mode.\nIn the screenshot above, we can see that the colour scaling in the spectrogram appears reasonable: Tonal calls of Antarctic blue whales are visible at ~26 Hz, more prominently on channel 0 than channel 1, but above the background noise on both channels.\nThe panel on the bottom shows the instantaneous spectrum (i.e. spectrum at the latest time slice). In the screenshot above, the spectrum for channel 0 (blue) shows the characteristic shape of that of a DIFAR sonobuoy with good VHF reception (i.e. strong omnidirectional signal from 0-3 kHz, carrier tones at 7.5 and 15 kHz, and directional signals modulated onto both sides of the 15 kHz carrier). The flat spectrum shown for channel 1 (red) indicates that DIFAR processing is unlikely to be successful or reliable, despite the presence of what appears to be a 26 Hz call of an Antarctic blue whale at approximately 60 s.\nIn this specific case, we know that the sonobuoy associated with channel 1 was simply too far away to give adequate VHF reception for further DIFAR processing, however the time of arrival difference between the calls can still provide a strong indication that the calling whale is closer to the sonobuoy on channel 0 than the one on channel 1 (assuming that the detections on each channel actually correspond to the same call). This type of process, i.e. thought experiment starting from first principles, serves as useful reality check whenever using DIFAR sonobuoys, regardless of whether they seem to be operating reliably or not.\nIf the colour contrast or time-frequency resolution of the spectrogram is not to your liking, adjust and re-run until they are fit for purpose.\nAt this point it is wise to make a backup copy of your data/ existing PAMGuard databases before any post-processing, since post-processing may alter tables, rows, and columns of the PAMGuard database."

Instead the various displays you�ll need should be configured on the Difar Display panel.\n\nSpectrogram Overlays and Manual Detections\nThe Low frequency FFT (Spectrogram) should have already been added to the Difar Display, but now that we have a DIFAR Localisation module we can configure the DIFAR specific overlays and functionality. Right-click on each channel of the spectrogram and ensure that both Queued DIFAR Data, and Processed DIFAR Data are checked. Remember overlays for Queued and Processed DIFAR Data must be enabled separately for each channel.\n\nAdditionally, if you plan to mark detections by hand on the spectrogram then it is important to enable the DIFAR Localisation module to function as a Mark Observer on the spectrogram. Right-click on either channel of the spectrogram, select Settings �; select the Mark Observers tab, and ensure that DIFAR Localisation is checked.\n\n\n\nMap Overlays and Data Selectors\nFor single-monitor setups, you may also want to add an additional map to the DIFAR display. Speaking of maps, it is important to configure the Map Overlays for the DIFAR Localisation.\nRight-click on the Map and select Plot overlay options �\nEnsure that Plot and All are checked for both Array manager, Streamer Data as well as DIFAR Localisation, Processed DIFAR Data. Note that there are additional options available for the DIFAR Localisation, Processed DIFAR Data, and these can be accessed via the configuration button (i.e. the button with the gear icon). In future releases of the DIFAR Module the gear-icon will allow filtering of DIFAR bearings by species, amplitude, and tonal frequency.\n\nNB: Map overlays must be configured for each map module, so if you added an extra Map to the Difar Display, you will need to perform these steps on both that Map, and the one that is in the separate Map tab.\nIn addition to the Map Overlays, there are also DIFAR Localisation display options� under the Display menu. The default values for these options are perfectly acceptable, and further documentation for these options are available in PAMGuard�s Help System.\n\n\nDIFAR Displays\nIn addition to the spectrogram and map, a DIFAR Queue and a DIFAR Processing display are required to analyse DIFAR data.\nDifar Display -&gt; New DIFAR Localisation Queue\nDifar Display -&gt; New DIFAR Localisation Displays\n\n\n\ndifarUserDisplayMenu\n\n\nThe DIFAR Localisation Display does not require any configuration, and further documentation can be found in PAMGuard�s online help system.\nThe DIFAR Localisation Queue will likely need to be modified from the default settings in order to tailor the presentation of audio to suit the target species. Click the small downward pointing arrow below the label Actions to expand the viewing options for queued clips. Clips selected for DIFAR Processing will appear in the queue as a spectrogram, and the sample rate for these clips is determined by the sample rate for the Default �species.�\nGenerally, the Min Amplitude should be adjusted to the same value that is used by the spectrogram: for the data from the 2013 ABW Voyage 40 dB works well. In my experience, DIFAR sonobuoys typically have a dynamic range of about 40-60 dB, so set the Amplitude Range to 40 dB. The FFT Length of the Queue will need to provide adequate frequency resolution at the sample rate of the Default species (which we set to 2000 Hz in the section above). The following settings are recommended for viewing clips of low-frequency sounds from blue and fin whales:\nMin Amplitude: 40 dB\nAmplitdue Range: 40 dB\nFFT Length: 1024 pt\nScale\nHorizontal: 8.00 x\nVertical: 0.25 x\nMax Niquist X:0.10\nMax Clips: 300\nMax Minutes: 120\nNew Clips Last: (checked)\n\nAfter configuration, the Queue settings panel can be hidden to make more room for clips by clicking the formerly downwards, but now upwards facing arrow on the far left of the panel."

However, the Sound Output can be used to control the overall speed of post-processing by adjusting the playback rate.\nSettings -&gt; Sound Output �\nIt is recommended that you not use the Raw input data from Sound Acquisition as the Data source. Rather, use either the Downsample to 6 kHz or Downsample to 250 Hz, as these will facilitate playback at a faster rate, and also have filtered the constant loud whistling of the 7.5 and 15 kHz DIFAR pilot tones. Make sure that at least one Channel is checked to enable the sound output. Also, make sure that the checkbox to Use default playback rate is unchecked. Though it may not be obvious, the post-processing speed will now be limited by the ratio of the sample rate of the Data source divided by the Playback rate. Thus, for the data source Downsample to 6 kHz a Playback rate of 48000 Hz will yield a post-processing speed of approximately eight times faster than real-time (provided that your computer has sufficient CPU processing ability to maintain that speed). Additionally, the �sped-up� audio will be played through the output device (i.e. speakers) with pitch shifted by the same ratio. For low frequency sounds from blue and fin whales, shifting the pitch this way can facilitate aural detection of calls that would ordinarily be too low in frequency to be audible to most people.\nNB: You can adjust the Playback rate during post-processing in order to speed up long periods with little whale activity, or to slow down post-processing if there are many sounds of interest displayed on the spectrogram."

    "text": "The spectrogram display serves several purposes. Firstly it provides a visual check that the DIFAR signal is being received correctly. Secondly it allows the operator to manually mark out sounds they want to be processed with the DIFAR system. Lastly, it provides visual indication of the detections and classifications that are in the DIFAR Queue and/or have been processed.\n\n\n\nImage of Spectrogram with marks and spectrum plugin\n\n\nThe figure shows a typical spectrogram display using one DIFAR sensors. The spectrogram is displaying the low frequency FFT data, with a bandwidth of 0 to 125 Hz. The lower panel is showing the instantaneous spectra from the 48kHz data. In this lower panel clear spectral peaks are visible at 7.5kHz and at 15kHz. These are the carrier frequencies for the frequency modulated signal from the DIFAR buoy. If these peaks are not clearly visible, then it�s likely that the DIFAR buoy is out of range or there is a problem with your receiving system.\nThere are also broader �humps� in the bottom panel which represent the multiplexed signals from the three acoustic sensors. The hump between 0 and about 4 kHz is the spectrum of data received on the omnidirectional hydrophone. This is broadly similar in shape to the humps either side of the 15kHz carrier which are the signals on the two directional sensors.\nTo mark a sound simply place the mouse on the spectrogram at the start of a sound and drag to the end of a sound. While you are dragging, other marks on the spectrogram will temporarily disappear. While dragging, the mark will also appear on every channel, although only the channel you are marking will be used in DIFAR processing.\nIf marks do not appear on the spectrogram display the most likely cause is that the mark observers on the spectrogram display have not been correctly configured. Once a sound has been marked on the spectrogram it will be sent to the DIFAR queue.\nOn the spectrogram itself, sounds that are in the DIFAR Queue will be indicated with a black rectangle with a dashed line corresponding to the mark. Sounds that have been assigned a classification will appear as colored marks corresponding to the color assigned to that classification. A solid line around a clip indicates that those sounds that have been processed and saved and are no longer in the DIFAR Queue.\n\nDIFAR Side-panel\nThe DIFAR Selection side-panel can be used to combine the process of manually marking of sounds and assigning classifications. When the Assign classification checkbox is checked, the highlighted classification will be automatically applied to newly created clips. When combined with the option to Auto-process classified clips, this will further streamline operation and reduce the need to interact with the DIFAR queue. This mode of operation is especially streamlined when there are only a few different classifications are present in a recording.\nWhen checked, the Multi-Channel checkbox will apply classifications and create individual DIFAR clips from each of the audio channels in a given Raw Data source. When unchecked (the default option), a clip will be created only for the marked channel. Multi-Channel is typically the most useful when sonobuoys have been deployed very close to each-other.\nPrevious: Running the DIFAR System\nNext: Managing the Queue",

    "title": "Types of Array",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The type of localisation that can be performed depends a lot on the size and shape of the hydrophone array. A short linear array of two or more hydrophones can measure a single bearing to a detected sound, but not estimate range. A longer linear array may also be able to estimate range. Similarly, a small horizontally aligned triangle of hydrophones can estimate an unambiguous bearing in the horizontal plane and possibly also an elevation angle, although the elevation angle will be subject to an up-down ambiguity. Large arrays of several widely distributed hydrophones can estimate locations in three dimensions.\n\nSmall and large, compact and distributed, small and wide aperture\nThese terms are often used to describe hydrophones arrays. All are easily stated, but not so easily understood and what is a wide aperture array for one species may be considered a compact array for a different species.\nIn the current context, a small or compact array is an array who’s dimension is a) much smaller than the detection range of the sounds being detected such that animals are almost guaranteed to be outside the volume or area of the array, and b) small enough that the time difference between the arrival of sounds on the different receivers is never (or rarely) confused my multiple arrivals, and c) small enough that a sound received on one receiver is almost guaranteed to be visible on all of them.\nA large or wide aperture array, on the other hand, is likely to be large enough that many animals will be within, or at least relatively close to, the area or volume covered by the receivers. Detection of a sound on one receiver is no guarantee of detection on other receivers and the arrival of multiple sounds on the different receivers may cause ambiguities in working out which sounds match on the different receivers.\nAs a general rule (remembering that rules are there to be broken) is that whatever the dimension of the array, 2 or 3D localisation is excellent within the volume of the array and is OK out to 3, or sometimes even 10 times the array dimension. Beyond that distance, bearing estimation is still possible, but errors on range become so large that the range estimations have no validity. It therefore follows that a compact array is good for bearing measurements, whereas a wider aperture array can be used for 2 or 3D localisation.\n\n\nHydrophone Spacing\nMost PAMGuard localisers are based upon Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurements between multiple hydrophones. Time differences can be measured more accurately with high frequency sounds sampled at high sample rates. With advanced signal processing, time differences can be measured to a fraction of a sample and to a fraction of a wavelength of the detected sound. For example, Gillespie and Macaulay (2019) showed that for harbour porpoise like clicks (Frequency 130kHz, wavelength 1.2cm) sampled at 500kHz, they could measure TDOA’s to an accuracy of a few microseconds - that’s 1/100ths of a sample, or well below 1/100’th of a wavelength. Gillespie et. al, 2020 describe how three small aperture arrays of dimension 30cm cold be used to accurately measure bearings to porpoise clicks and that three of these clusters spaced over several metres formed a wide aperture array which could be used to localise porpoise clicks in three dimensions.\nAt the other extreme, say working with blue whales, which can produce sounds at 15Hz (wavelength 100m) you’d hardly expect to get a blue whale within an array a few metres across and would probably want to detect them out to a distance of several 10’s of km. Timing measurements to blue whale sounds will also be far less accurate than for porpoise clicks (milliseconds rather than a fraction of a microsecond) so the wide aperture array used for porpoises would be a compact array for blue whales.\n\n\nNumbers of Hydrophones\nHydrophones are expensive to purchase and both complex and expensive to deploy, but you do need to make sure you have enough for the type of localisation you’re aiming to use.\nLocalisations can be in one, two or three dimensions and are most often described in polar (bearing and range) or cartesian (x,y,z) space.\nWhichever system is used, a pair of hydrophones can measure a single time difference, so can resolve one dimension. Three hydrophones can measure two independent time differences, so can estimate two dimensions (e.g. x and y or latitude and longitude) and four hydrophones can measure three independent time differences, so can in principle estimate three dimensions.\nHowever, the reality is often that at least one extra hydrophone is required to resolve ambiguities. For example, a pair of hydrophones will measure a bearing, but it will be ambiguous, whereas a triangle of hydrophones can measure a surface bearing without ambiguity. A common misconception is that three widely spaced hydrophones can provide two dimensional localisations. The truth is that while animals within the array will probably get an unambiguous position, positions outside the array can sometimes still be ambiguous (Spiesberger, 2001). As an illustration of this, the figures below show hyperbolic localisations from a two dimensional 3 element array. The first localisation does not have am ambiguity, but the second one clearly does.\n \nThe addition of a fourth hydrophone will resolve the ambiguity for a two dimensional array. Five hydrophones are required for unambiguous 3D localisation.\n\n\nReferences\nGillespie, D., and Macaulay, J.

This simply refers the number of seconds between two hydrophones receiving the same acoustic signal. In order to get to this stage vocalisations must be first detected, classified and then the time delay between two likely signals from the same source calculated. The calculation itself must be highly accurate and cannot rely on simply determining the rough start of two signals without introducing large errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\nFor example a harbour porpoise click consists of an ultra-short directional pulse of sound with a peak frequency of around 130kHz . The complex internal structure of a cetacean’s biosonar means that click waveforms are not uniform and highly dependent on a multitude of factors. A ‘direct’ click detected along the longitudinal axis of the animal, for example, will differ in waveform from the same click recorded at an angle. Thus often incident on each hydrophone are clicks of similar peak frequency but very different waveforms as shown in Figure. 1. The distance between the hydrophones in this case was 0.25m. Although only a fraction of a millisecond in length in order to work out an accurate time delay between such clicks, a cross correlation function must be utilised. This method slides one waveform along the time axis of the other, calculating the integral of the product of both waveforms over a range of different times. The accepted mathematical form is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere x(?) and y*(?-t) (* refers to the complex conjugate) represent two waveforms with a time separation of t. This results in the time dependent function Cxy(t). The integral is essentially proportional to the area beneath the two waveforms and so if they overlap precisely this produces a large value. Hence Cxy(t) is a measure of the similarity between two waveforms over time with its maximum value corresponding to the likely time delay between the two signals.\nPAMGuard applies advanced time delay measurements to most of it’s time of arrival estimates, allowing the peak in the cross correlation function to be determined to a much higher accuracy than a single sample. You can read more in Gillespie and Macaulay, 2019.\n\n\nLocalising\nAs long as the distance between the two receiving hydrophones is known a measured time delay can then be used to restrict the possible location of an acoustic source. In the case of just two hydrophones the source is theoretically restricted to a three dimensional hyperboloid of infinite length. It is perhaps easier to visualise this in two dimensions in which case the hyperboloid can be considered as two possible symmetrical bearings pointing towards the source. By introducing another pair of hydrophones and hence another time delay measurement the location of the source can restricted further. Now the only possible locations are the points at which the hyperboloid surfaces calculated for each hydrophone pair cross.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of two pairs of hydrophones (each pair is represented by a black box) each restricting the possible source locations to a hyperboloid surface (because the hydrophones are relatively close together the hyperboloid can be considered as two cones). The two cones intersect along a highlighted circle and hence the only possible locations of the source are on this circle. However there are four hydrophones in this array and hence this actually corresponds to six time delay measurements between hydrophones, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4 and 3-4. Thus it is possible to restrict the source location further depending on the array geometry. In Figure 2 the hydrophones are placed in-line with each other. This in-line symmetry results in the possible source locations always being restricted to a circle independent of the number of hydrophones used. In general the mathematical rules governing localisation require at least three hydrophones (two time delay measurements) to locate the source in two dimensions and at least four hydrophones (over three time delay measurements) to locate a source in three dimensions.\nThe number and distribution of hydrophones therefore play a key role in localisation; however other measurements also restrict the source location. The maximum detectable range of a harbour porpoise click is on the order of a few hundred meters whilst blue whales are detectable tens of kilometres away. Thus the possible ranges are restricted simply by the frequency of a vocalisation. In addition both the seabed and sea surface provide limits restricting the source location.\n\n\nLocalisation Errors\nIn an ideal world, if we knew the exact spacing between hydrophones, accurate sound speed profiles in all locations and the precise time delay of a signal it would be possible to localise the exact location of any detectable sound source. However, reality, down to the smallest fundamental units, is built on probability and the same applies to localisation. Errors in measurements, from digitising a signal to measuring the distance between different hydrophones, are inherent within every acoustic monitoring system. How this error propagates through to source positions is an important aspect of localisation and needs to be calculated accurately.\nTime delay errors generally occur due to unsynchronised signals and/or errors in cross correlating different waves. For example, if a wave is digitally sampled every 1.41x10 -5 seconds (96kS/s) then in an ideal situation the time delay is accurate to +/- 1.41x10-5/2. This can be reduced by applying a polynomial fit to the cross correlation mimicking a more analogue wave. However, the cross correlation function itself is not always accurate, especially with spectrally pure signals, such as those produced by harbour porpoises. Therefore time delay errors, as well as being dependent on the sampling frequency are also often species dependent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPropagation and speed of sound provide another important source of error. The speed of sound in seawater is not constant, with temperature, salinity and pressure gradients resulting in variable sound speed profiles. This results the bending of acoustic rays and can introduce a significant source of error, especially over large distances. Figure 3 shows a ray trace diagram of a porpoise click in a measured environment with a variable sound speed profile. Here temperature and salinity gradients cause significant bending of the acoustic signals creating a waveguide effect. Although this is an extreme case it is clear that assuming a constant sound speed in this particular instance would incur large localisation errors.\nThe geometry of an array is critical in error propagation. The first and most obvious error is the uncertainty in the position of each hydrophone. After a time delay measurement any error in the position of a hydrophone pair will alter the position of the resulting hyperboloid surface. This then changes the calculated possible source locations. The degree to which the source location is moved due to this and other errors is related to the geometry of the array. For example, consider two pairs of hydrophones, separated by 0.5m and located 1m apart from each other. Assume an error in measurement results in one of the calculated hyperboloid surfaces shifting by one degree; this then propagates to a range error of 1.9m. However if the hydrophone pairs are moved 10m apart the same error in measurement results in a range error of just 0.41m.\nThis suggests that arrays should be spaced as widely as possible. This is indeed the case with evenly distributed, widely spaced hydrophones theoretically providing the most accurate localisations. However, cetacean vocalisations only propagate a finite distance and depending on species are often highly directional. Therefore arrays are fundamentally restricted in size even before the practical considerations of deployment are taken into consideration.\nThe natural environment and especially the sea are fundamentally unpredictable places. The complexity of these environments means a complete and accurate mathematical model is impossible. Instead errors must be accepted as always present and localisations should always be regarded as probabilities of a source location.\n\n\nReferences\nGillespie, D., and Macaulay, J. 2019.

This may be because bearings have already been calculated by an internal algorithm within the detector, as is the case for the Click and Whistle and Moan detectors, or it may be a detection that has had bearing information added to it by the Bearing Localiser. This algorithm is also suitable for calculating positions from multiple DIFAR buoys.\nThe Hyperbolic algorithm can be used to localise single detections from widely spaced hydrophones so long as Time Difference of Arrival measurements can be accurately made between the different hydrophone channels. Localisation can be in either 2 or 3 dimensions.\nThe Simplex algorithm is an alternative to the Hyperbolic algorithm, working with the same data, but solving the problem in a different way.\nIt is difficult to predict which algorithm will provide the best performance, both in terms of how many sounds it manages to localise and the spatial accuracy of those localisations. The Crossed bearing algorithm is a sensible choice if multiple compact clusters of hydrophones have been deployed, especially if there is some uncertainty as to the quality of time synchronisation between the clusters (they will need to be synchronised well enough to match sounds on the different clusters, but not so perfectly that Time Difference of Arrival measurements are reliable between clusters). If individual detections do not have bearing information (as would be the case for most wide aperture arrays), then the Hyperbolic or the Simplex algorithms should be used. Even if hydrophones are in clusters and bearing information is available, these algorithms should be more accurate due to their use of the additional time delays between distant hydrophones.\nPrevious: Configuration\nNext: Crossed bearing algorithm",

    "text": "The crossed bearing algorithm can be used when hydrophones are arranged in small clusters, each of which can provide a bearing.\nFor example a towed hydrophone might contain two groups of hydrophones, with spacing within each group close enough that they can be considered a compact array, which can easily estimate bearings, but spacing between the hydrophone groups large enough that crossing angles can be used to estimate absolute source locations.\nIf using static equipment, then it may be possible to deploy groups of several multi-channel recorders. Channels within each recorder would be accurately time synchronised, so TDOA measurements from each recorder would provide accurate bearings, however time synchronisation between recorders may not be accurate enough for TDOA measurement, so crossed bearings could be used to combine data from multiple clusters.\nThe crossed bearing algorithm uses exactly the same internal algorithms as target motion analysis, which crosses bearings from multiple sounds from the same animal from different locations of a single compact array.\n\nConfiguration\nSelect the Crossed Bearings algorithms from the drop down list. Click on the configuration button to the right of the list to select one of three possible crossed bearing algorithms. You may also limit the maximum number of sounds used within the algorithm and select limits (Filters) on reasonable outputs - any localisation result outside these limits will be rejected.\nIn principle, it is possible to select more than one of the above algorithms, in which case all will be applied and PAMGuard will select the best result based on goodness of fit criteria. Generally, it is recommended that you test the options through simulation and then select one algorithms which is giving the best results. an exception might be when using a moving array, which might sometimes be in a linear line (so 3D location is definitely not possible) and sometimes might (for example as a boat turns) effectively form a plane. In this instance you might run both the 2D and 3D simplex algorithms and the ‘best’ model fit will be selected based on AIC.\n\n\nLeast Squares\nThis is the original target motion algorithm developed within PAMGuard. The algorithm is fast, but makes an assumption that all detections are being at points which form a straight line. It is therefore only suitable when there are no more than two hydrophone groups (or when they genuinely are in a straight line).\n\n\n2D Simplex\nThis algorithm can deal with any configuration of hydrophones arranges in a planar array and will only estimate positions in two dimensions.\nA Simplex algorithm is used to find a point which has the least squares error of bearings from each hydrophone cluster location. This algorithm is slightly more flexible and better at dealing with complex array geometries than the Least Squares algorithm above.\n\n\n3D Simplex\nThis algorithm is ideal for volumetric arrays. It can also work with planar arrays, though localisations may be subject to an ambiguity across the plane.\nThis algorithm is the most flexible and better at dealing with complex array geometries than the Least Squares or 2D Simplex algorithms above, but will fail with unsuitable array geometries.\nThe algorithm can work with hydrophone clusters of different types, e.g. with one tetrahedral cluster (producing bearings with unambiguous slant and elevation angles) and a pair of hydrophones (producing bearings with an ambiguity about the pair axis). Somewhat surprisingly, you can sometimes get a 3D location from two or more horizontal pairs of hydrophones, so long as they are not all in a line (forming a linear array).\nPrevious: Algorithms\nNext: hyperbolic localisation algorithm",

Select the one most suitable for your array geometry. Note that even with a 2D array, a better fit may be obtained using a 3D model than with 2D. As a general “rule of thumb”, if the vertical position of the animal is likely to be a significant fraction of the array dimension, then you’re probably better off using the 3D model. If on the other hand, the array is large and in shallow water, so that the vertical position can only ever be a small fraction of the array dimension, then the 2D model may be more stable.\nThe minimisation function used by the Simplex is created in the following manner:\n\nThe propagation delay from the location to each hydrophone is calculated.\nFrom these values, the difference in time delay for each hydrophone pair is calculated.\nAn estimate of the error on each time delay is calculated based on the errors on hydrophone locations entered into the Array Manager, the entered sound speed error and the relative orientation of the hydrophone pair to the location. The measured time delays from the appropriate TDOA calculation are compared to the calculated values for that pair, and a ?2 value constructed from the differences in measured and expected times divided by the expected errors.\n\nThe Simplex / Nelder-Mead algorithm then moves the location around to minimise the ?2 value.\n\nConfiguration\nTo configure, select “Simplex 2D” or “Simplex 3D” from the list of available algorithms.

Re-classify porpoise clicks with the better classifier in viewer mode, mark out interesting click features and view using concatenated spectrogram.\nYou have so far used PAMGuard to run through ten channels of raw .wav data and pick out porpoise clicks. All clicks, including classified porpoise clicks, have been saved in PAMGuard binary files. These are around 99.9% smaller than .wav files and contain all information needed to browse through click data and perform complex tasks, such as classification or localisation. In this exercise we will open binary files in PAMGuard viewer mode.\nStart PAMGuard viewer mode. PAMGuard will ask you to select a database. Select the database you used in analysing the .wav files. Next PAMGuard will ask you to select binary files.\n\nFigure 9. Open the binary files you saved.\nSelect the folder you saved binary files when using PAMGuard in standard mode. PAMGuard should now open. You will be presented with a click detector window which looks very similar to PAMGuard in standard mode.\n\n\n\nExtra scroll bar controls are present in many primary displays in PAMGuard viewer mode. Only a certain time period of click detections will be loaded into the computer’s memory at any one time. Only these detections are visible in the click detector display. To move to time period before or after the current data loaded data press the blue buttons. The middle button can be pressed to bring up a dialog box. Here you can define the period of data (Duration) to be loaded into memory. The Step Size defines the ‘jump’ to take to the next section of data. For example 75% means, when a new section of data is loaded, 25% of the previous section is left. The Start Time allows you to manually select where to load the data from.\n\n\nThere are, however, several important differences between the click detector in PAMGAURD viewer and standard mode. The scroll bars allow users to navigate through and load new sections of data. You will also find new displays are present and extra functionality exists to annotate clicks and add to events. Play around with the controls and load a new section of clicks.\n\n2.1 Reclassify clicks\nYou will notice after selecting some click detections, that the classifier we used in section 1 has missed a lot of porpoise clicks. For the purposes of localisation it is often better to have more false positives than false negatives. Therefore we need to reclassify clicks. Go to Click Detection &gt; Re Analyse Click Types… This will bring up the click analysis dialog box.\n\nFigure 10. Reprocessing clicks allows you to tweak classifier settings.\nTick the Reclassify Clicks check box and click on Settings… This will bring up the familiar click classifier manager from which you can access your classifier settings.\n \nIn the click classifier disable the Click Length and Zero Crossing settings. Click OK on the classifier and Classifier manager to return the Click Analysis dialog. In the Data Options drop down menu select All Data. This will perform data processing on all binary files rather than just the click detections currently loaded into memory. Click Start and wait for the processing to finish.\nYou should notice that the number of classified clicks visibly increases. Play around with the classifier until you are happy with the settings and the majority of the porpoise clicks are correctly classified.\n\n\n\n2.2 Create an Event\nThe PAMGuard Viewer click detector allows manual marking of events. Events usually consist of a group of clicks associated with one acoustic encounter of a particular species. Event information is saved to the database and in certain situations can be used to perform extra analysis\nDouble click on the amplitude time display. By repeatedly clicking with the mouse you can draw a bounding line around a group of clicks. By joining up the ends of the dotted line an area is selected and will be coloured grey.\n\nFigure 11. You can select groups of clicks to add to an event by drawing a shape around them and right clicking.\nThese clicks can now be saved as an event. Right click within the grey area and select New Event. Use Porpoise from the drop down menu and click OK. If there are no species in the dropdown menu you can right click and select Edit Species to add some. Your clicks should now turn a different colour which indicates this event is saved. By selecting Click Detection &gt; Show Eventsyou can bring up a dialog box showing selected events.\n\n\n\nevents\n\n\nFigure 12. Events can be accessed from the Event List.\nCreate a few events of interesting sections of clicks.\n\n\n2.3 View events on extra displays\nThere are a few extra displays in viewer mode which allow users to investigate more acoustic properties of clicks, especially once events have been selected.\nGo to Click Display &gt; Add Display… &gt; Concatenated Spectrogram. This will add the Concatenated Spectrogram display. Click on a click within an event to bring up the concatenated spectrogram for that event. You should see a narrow band of energy near 130kHz, typical for porpoise vocalisations.\n\nFigure 13. Concatenated Spectrogram of a set of porpoise clicks.

    "text": "Target motion localisation is used to detect and localise continuously vocalising cetaceans, usually clicking odontocetes. The process requires a moving hydrophone array, usually towed by a vessel and makes the assumptions that during a train of detected clicks the acoustic source is stationary.\nThese help pages concern themselves mostly with offline analysis of data using the PAMGuard viewer. Those interested in real time / online tracking using the PAMGuard click detector should refer to the Tracking and Click Train Identification section in the Click Detector section of the help.\nA towed array will detect a series of different clicks as it moves through the water. The path of the array, often referred to as the trackline, can be estimated by GPS units, accelerometers, gyroscopes and/or heading sensors. If the source is assumed to be stationary then each detected click corresponds to a set of time delays at some position along the trackline. Each set of time delays can be visualised as a 2D or 3D bearing, depending on the towed array, pointing towards the acoustic source. As more clicks are detected more bearings are calculated along the trackline and eventually they should begin to cross around the likely location of the source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows an example of target motion data using a single array of two hydrophones. Each detected click corresponds to a time delay which restricts the source location to a hyperboloid surface. Because the hydrophones are relatively close together this surface can be approximated as a cone and for simplicity Figure 1 represents this cone in 2D as a green and red bearing line. As the track line progresses more clicks are detected and a possible source location can be calculated. Figure 1 shows two possible source locations, where the red lines cross and where the green lines cross. Errors in the location of the array and the obviously incorrect assumption that the vocalising cetacean remains stationary means that the bearings will rarely cross at a single point. In the case of a paired array with a completely straight trackline this will always give two possible locations in 2D and a perfect circle of possible locations in 3D.\nHowever there is often information which can be used to minimise these errors. The trackline is rarely straight. It ‘wobbles’ constantly and therefore breaks the symmetry which results in the circular distribution of possible locations. This is evident in Figure 1 one were the green bearings appear to cross through a more consistent point compared the red bearings. The more the trackline deviates from a straight line the more the ambiguity in position begins to break down. Figure 2 shows a 3D localisation attempt of Figure 1 assuming a relatively high uncertainty in the position of the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the high uncertainty in the position of array masks the small wobble in the trackline and so a circular probability distribution results. Note the cetacean is unlikely to be located above the sea surface so a large chunk of this circular distribution can be disregarded.\nIf the uncertainty in the position of the array is reduced a different probability distribution results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the probability distribution calculated from ther same data as in Figure 2 but assuming an almost perfect knowledge of the array position corresponding to the path of the trackline. Here the wobble in the trackline has resulted in a much tighter probability distribution with the most likely location of the cetacean being almost directly beneath the array.\nLocalisation results are therefore a combined product of the expected uncertainties in measurements, the design of the towed array and the degree to which the trackline deviates from a straight line. PAMGuard features multiple localisation algorithms which take all these factors into account.\nNext: Localising an Event\nReferences\nDetection of beaked whales using near surface towed hydrophones: prospects for survey and mitigation J.

    "text": "Adding an GPS Processing Module\nTo add a new GPS Data Collection module to PAMGuard, select the File-&gt;Maps and Mapping-&gt;GPS Processing menu item.\nNote that it is only possible to have one GPS Processing module in PAMGuard, so the menu item will be greyed out if a module has already been added.\n\n\nSetting the GPS Parameters\nFrom the Detection Menu, select GPS&gt;GPS Options ?\n\n\n\nGPS Options\n\n\n\n\nSelect NMEA Data Source\nSelect the NMEA data source from the drop down list. If there are no NMEA Data Collection modules in the current PAMGuard model, you must close the GPS Options dialog and add one.\n\nMain Navigation data string\nA number of different NMEA Strings (or NMEA sentences) contain navigation data. The first five letters of each sentence identify the type of data in the rest of the sentence. The most common sentences with GPS data are is GPRMC, but occasionally some GPS receivers may only output GPGGA data.\nOn very rare occasions, if the GPS data have been multiplexed through some other instruments, the first two characters of the string identifier are changed. If this is the case, it may also be necessary to set these so that the GPS module can identify the appropriate data. As an alternative, select the “Allow and string initials” option which will use any valid RMC or GGA string. Note however, that with a complex NMEA system there may be more than one GPS and it is better to select only strings from the most accurate\n\n\n\nRead Options\nThree options for reading and storing GPS data are available.\nRead all GPS data: all GPS data will be used, however often they arrive (typically once per second).\nRead at fixed time intervals: GPS Data will only be used at fixed time intervals (say 10s).\nRead on timer or course of speed change: GPS data will be used at fixed time intervals or whenever the course or speed change.\nThe latter options minimises the amount of data stored when undertaking straight line transects. PAMGuard will interpolate between GPS positions, so it is possible to set a relatively long time interval (say 1 minute) for regular reads, but data will get read more often if there are course or speed changes.\n\n\nHeading Data\nA GPS receiver can only directly measure a vessels position in space. GPS receivers output course information based on successive measurements of position. This course is therefore the direction the vessel is moving in relative to the earth, which is not necessarily the direction the vessel is pointing in. For instance, the vessel may be moving sideways in a cross current.\nThe course information from a GPS is generally referred to as Course Over Ground, or COG.\nA number of options exist for reading the true heading of a vessel, i.e. the direction it is pointing in. These are:\n\nA gyro compass (Generally only available on larger vessels. Gives a heading relative to true North)\nA fluxgate compass (A cheaper options which measures the magnetic heading of the vessel)\nA twin GPS heading sensor (Two GPS receivers close together. The relative positions of the two receivers are accurate enough to give true heading\n\nMost of the above devices will output an NMEA string GPHDT which contains either the true or the magnetic heading information, depending on the type of sensor.\nPAMGuard can read the GPHDT string and will add the heading information to the data from the GPS receiver. The heading data are displayed on the map and are also written to the GPSData database table\n\n\n\nHeading Data\n\n\nTo read heading data, go to the Heading tab, check the ‘Read heading data’ check box. Then select the NMEA data source. Note that with some NMEA installations, the heading data string may be in the same multiplexed data as the GPS data, in others, it may be on a separate serial data stream.\n\n\nVessel Options\nClicking the vessel tab allows you to specify where the GPS receiver is on the vessel.\n\n\n\nVessel Options\n\n\nEnter the ships dimensions and select an optional heading arrow to be shown on the map. These parameters affect displays only and have no other effect on PAMGuard operation.\nPrevious: Configuring NMEA\nNext: Clock Options",

    "text": "Often on larger boats, NMEA signals will be distributed by wire and available at several location.\nConnection to a 9 pin serial connector is very simple. In a 9 pin D plug connect:\n\nPin 2 to NMEA Data in (‘Data Out’ form GPS or other NMEA device)\nPin 5 to Ground (usually the same wire as connects to the negative of the power supply)\n\nIt is not necessary to make any other connections. PAMGuard does not send any data back to the GPS, so connection of Pin 3 (NMEA Data Out) is not necessary.\n\nUsing Serial to USB converters\nMost PC’s no longer have a built in serial (RS-232) port. If you don’t have a serial port, then purchase a serial to USB converter. Follow the manufacturers installation instructions for the converter and once installed connect your NMEA device. Your device will appear in the NMEA configuration dialog as a normal serial port.\nNote that if you move the serial to USB converter to a different serial port, then your operating system may re-install the drivers and assign a different serial port number, in which case you will have to reconfigure the NMEA settings in PAMGuard.\n\n\nUsing a USB GPS\nSome GPS’s have an USB connector instead of a serial one. In reality, the data are still the same serial data as from a GPS with a serial output, but a USB to serial converter has been built into the GPS. Therefore connect your GPS and install the manufacturers software drivers as you would for a serial to USB converter described above.\n\n\nConnecting one NMEA source to Multiple Computers\nIf you want to connect an NMEA device to multiple computers, then it’s generally possible to split an NMEA signal from a serial device and input it to multiple serial ports. If you do do this, ensure that only pins 2 and 5 are connected.\nPrevious: Configuring NMEA",

The data are exported as R structs with the same fields as in MATLAB (and PAMBinaries package). To open a an RData frame open RStudio and import the file or use;\nload(\"/my/path/to/file.RData\")\n\n\nWav files\nAny detection which contains raw sound data, for example a click, clip or deep learning detection, can be exported as a wav file. When wav files are selected three options are presented for saving files.\n\nWhen wav files are selected additional options are presented on how to save the file\n\nZero pad : Here detections are saved as wav files with the time in between detections zero padded. The resulting files will be as large as the initial wav files processed to create the data. This can be useful if for example opening the files in another acoustic analysis program.\nConcatenate : The detections are saved to a wav file without any zero padding. This saves storage space but temporal information is lost within the wav file. The sample positions of each detection are saved in a text file along with the wav file so that temporal info is available if needed. This is same format as SoundTrap click detection data.\nIndividual : Each detection is saved in it’s own time stamped individual sound file.",

    "text": "PAMGuard has two data storage options:\n\nThe Database\nThe Binary Store\n\nEach has advantages and disadvantages.\nThe great advantage of the database is that stored data are generally in a form which is each to read either as a human, or via some other software. However, the database interface can be slow and the database is very inefficient at handling variable length records, such as the waveform of a click, or the contour of a whistle.\nThe Binary store is fast and is great at handling any type of data, but the files are impossible to read except with proprietary computer software. There are software packages for Matlab and R which can read the binary files and we’re working on Python.\nSome modules can only write to the database and some only to the binary store. Some modules, on the other hand, offer the choice of writing to both.\nFor all modules, the user can control whether or not data are stored in each location. This is controlled from the File/Storage options menu. Selecting this menu command will bring up a dialog looking something like this:\n\nAlthough the exact appearance will of course depend on which modules are loaded.\nGenerally, you are advised to make sure that all data are being stored in at least one of the locations and you should be aware that for data which have both options, it’s quite possible that less data will be stored in the database than in the binary store - for instance,the click detector does not store the click waveform in the database and the whistle detector does not store the whistle contour in the database.\nPrevious: Multi-threading\nNext: Performance Tests",

GPS data recycled through the system are not re-written to the database.\n\nStarting PAMGuard Mixed mode operation\nPAMGuard Mixed mode can be started from the shortcut to PAMGuard mixed mode placed on your system when you installed PAMGuard.\nIf you are using one of the platform independent jar files, then run the jar file with the program argument -m. For instance, under Windows, the command line for starting PAMGuard Beta version 1.3.02 in mixed mode with 1 Gigabyte of memory is:\njava -jar -mx4096m PAMGuardBeta_2_02_15.jar PAMGuard -m\n\n\nRunning PAMGuard Mixed Mode\nWhen PAMGuard starts in Mixed mode, it will not ask for a psfx file, but will instead ask for a database file to open.\nYou must select a database which was previously filled with data from PAMGuard.\nAs with Viewer mode, PAMGuard will read it’s configuration settings from the database and not from a psfx file.\nConfigure the sound acquisition module to take data either from a file or a file folder.\nWhen you start PAMGuard, there may be a pause of a few seconds as GPS and other data are extracted from the database.\nIncluding a sound output module in your model will enable you to hear the sounds and will also control the speed of analysis so that data are analysed in real time.\nIf you do not include a sound output module, data will be processed as fast as the machine is able.

    "text": "PAMGuard contains of an ever growing number of modules, each of which performs some sort of data handling task. Individual modules may do anything from acquiring sound data, to managing a database, or searching for a particular sound type. Generally, every module will acquire data either from another module, or through some external interface (such as a sound card, GPS or depth sensor readout). The output of a module may be a display, more data or both. Data might be stored in the PAMGuard database or binary store, or might just be there for other modules to subscribe to. A single module may have multiple output data streams. For instance, the sound acquisition module primarily outputs raw audio data to other PAMGuard modules, but also outputs data providing a record of when sound acquisition was started and stopped which can be stored in the database.\nPAMGuard currently contains 70 modules which can be selected and configured by the user (See the table below). It is generally possible to create multiple instances of a given module type. For instance, the operator may wish to incorporate two click detectors, each optimised for a different species, or have two sound acquisition modules, one acquiring low frequency data and one high frequency data. For certain module types (e.g. GPS acquisition), the user may be restricted to having a single instance.\nWe are constantly developing new modules for PAMGuard. The table also includes some information on modules which we’re working on at the moment. Due to PAMGuard being open source, there may of course be other modules under development we don’t yet know about.\nLast updated 27 November 2024\nMaps and Mapping, Utilities, Sensors, Displays, Sound Processing, Detectors, Classifiers, Localisers, Visual Methods",

    "section": "",
    "text": "PAMGuard can operate in either a single thread mode, or a multi-thread mode.\nIn multi-thread mode, each process within each PAMGuard module operates in a different processing thread, which allows several processes to take place at once in a multiprocessor computer.\nIn single thread mode, actions take place one at a time as data propagates through PAMGuard.\nThe advantage of multi-thread operation is that the different tasks will spread between multiple processing cores on the computer, thereby gaining access to more processing power.\nIn single thread operation, only a single processing core will be used, so less processing power is available.\nMulti-threading may introduce instability in some modules, where certain processes have to happen in a certain sequence. It can also mean that the last second or so of a file, when re-processing offline, may still be in a buffer when processing stops, so never get analysed. So although multi-threading is usually preferable, single thread operation is maintained as an option.\nAs an example, when using PAMGuard to decimate wav files using three modules: Sound acquisition to read the files, a Decimator to drop the frequency, and a Sound Recorder to make lower frequency wav files, it’s better to turn multi-threading off, which will ensure no samples are lost, and in any case there would be no advantages in having multiple threads since you’re only doing one thing.\n\nTurning multi-threading on and off\nMulti-threading can be turned on and off from the Detection&gt;Multi-threading menu command.\n\n\n\nMain Menu\n\n\nYou can also set the amount of “jitter” between threads. This is the maximum amount of data that can be queued between two threads. If the data queue exceeds this time, then the earlier thread will wait until the second thread has processed some of the data in the queue.\nMore jitter allows more flexibility between threads which can allow PAMGuard to use multiple processor cores more efficiently. However, increased jitter can cause a loss of synchronisation between the processing, graphics output and sound play back. Generally, the default setting of 1000ms is about right for most operations.\n\nGarbage Collection\nThe Java language handles garbage collection (clean up of unused objects in memory) very efficiently. Sometimes though it’s helpful to give it a ‘nudge’ and tell it to clean up more often in which case the ‘Run additional garbage collection’ option can be used.\nPrevious: Project Information\nNext: Data Storage",

    "text": "Installing and Running\n\nSince PAMGuard release 2.02.03, PamDog has been included in the PAMGuard build, but is not set up to run automatically when Windows starts. To start PamDog, you no longer need to install Java yourself. Simply double click on the file PamguardBeta_WatchDog.exe which you’ll find in the PAMGuard installation folder (probably C:\\Program Files\\Pamguard). See below for instructions on making PamDog start with Windows.\nBy default, no user interface will be displayed. PamDog will run in the background and can be configured via an icon which will appear in the Tray Icon area, that’s the little icons down in the bottom right corner of the Windows task bar\n\nConfiguring and Starting PAMGuard\nIf you are using the watchdog DO NOT start PAMGuard in the normal way from the Windows Start menu. PamDog has to start PAMGuard with some specific options enabled so that PamDog and PAMGuard can communicate. These options will not be available if you’ve started PAMGuard from the Start menu.\nA typical sequence of operations required to use PamDog successfully is as follows:\n\nWith PamDog deactivated, launch PAMGuard from the Start menu in the normal way, configure it how you want, check it’s all running OK and save your psfx file.\nClose PAMGuard.\nOpen the PamDog configuration dialog and configure PamDog with the correct paths and options to Java, the Pamguard executable and your psfx file.\nActivate PamDog, sit back and allow PamDog to launch and start PAMGuard.\nIf you need to modify your configuration in anyway, deactivate PamDog and repeat the above steps.\n\n\n\nStarting PamDog Automatically\nYou should not run more than one instance of PamDog at a time. Most users will want PamDog to launch automatically when Windows starts. To make PamDog launch automatically, the easiest way is simply to create a shortcut to the PamguardBeta_WatchDog.exe program in your Start folder.\nTo locate the Start folder click on the Windows Start button, then RIGHT click on ‘All Programs’.

All controls in the dialog have tool tips - hover the mouse over them and they will provide some information on what they do.\n\nControl\n\nThe Control panel controls whether or not the Watchdog is active. If the watchdog is correctly configured and the “Activate Watchdog” button is checked, then PAMGuard will be launched automatically and if PAMGuard is stopped, will immediately restart\nActivate Watchdog: Activates or deactivates the watchdog.\nUDP Port: UDP (network protocol) port for communication between PamDog and PAMGuard.\nAllow system restarts: Will restart Windows if the watchdog fails to start PAMGuard several times in succession. Note that if this option is selected and PAMGuard cannot start for some fundamental reason, such as an acquisition device becoming disconnected, then the computer will continually reboot. The reboot cycle is relatively slow so there should always be sufficient time one the computer has restarted to deactivate the watchdog.\nopen log file folder: Opens a folder containing PAMGuard and PamDog log files. Note that information displayed in the terminal window when PAMGuard is running normally is written to a log file when PAMGuard is launched by PamDog.\n\n\nPamguard\n\nThe Pamguard panel controls the location of important PAMGuard files and folders and tells PamDog which PAMGuard configuration file should be used.\nWorking Directory: The folder containing the PAMGuard executable jar file.

    "text": "Background\nThe PAMGuard project was established to provide a world standard software infrastructure for acoustic detection, localisation, and classification for use in mitigating against the risk of harm to marine mammals, and for research into their abundance, distribution and behaviour.\nMany marine activities involve underwater sound emissions. To mitigate against harm to marine mammals, observers are often employed to visually scan the sea surface for the presence of animals. In the event of a sighting, procedures such as suspension/delay of activities may be implemented to avoid harm. Visual observations play a vital role, but marine mammals are difficult to spot on the sea surface, especially when weather and light conditions are poor. However, many marine mammals produce loud and distinctive vocalisations, which can often be detected more reliably than visual cues. For these species, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers an effective means of detection.\n\n\nThe PAMGuard Approach\nPAMGuard provides open-source PAM software based on a platform-independent (e.g. Windows, Linux, Macintosh OS), flexible, modular architecture. The open-source aspect of software development is facilitated through the project’s presence on GitHub, where a community of altruistic developers can provide extra resources. PAMGuard is currently maintained by a team of Research Scientists at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Open development means that the software is free and that access to the code is easy and assured. It also allows the code’s copyright to be protected in perpetuity so that it cannot readily be closed and commercialised to the detriment of its users. It ultimately ensures that more people have easy access for development. This generally speeds up innovations and improves the performance and maintainability of the code.\nIt is anticipated that the PAM community will support this initiative and donate their intellect and facilities to assist PAMGuard in achieving its goal. Involvement in the PAMGuard community allows researchers and industry to develop and contribute to a technology which will provide an important tool for the understanding and protection of the marine environment.\nNext: PAMGuard Architecture",

    "text": "The PAMGuard viewer can be used to view data stored in the PAMGuard database and the binary storage system.\nSome viewer operations, such as the spectrogram display also load and re-process small amounts of raw audio data from sound files (if available).\n\nStarting PAMGuard Viewer\nThe PAMGuard viewer can be started from the shortcut to PAMGuard Viewer placed on your system when you installed PAMGuard.\nIf you are using one of the platform independent jar files, then run the jar file with the program argument -v. For instance, under Windows, the command line for starting PAMGuard Beta version 1.3.02 in viewer mode with 1 Gigabyte of memory is:\njava -jar -mx4096m PAMGuardBeta_2_02_15.jar PAMGuard -v\n\n\nRunning PAMGuard Viewer\nWhen PAMGuard starts in Viewer mode, it will not ask for a psfx file, but will instead ask for a database file to open. Normally, you should select a database which was previously filled with data from PAMGuard. However, if data were collected using only Binary Storage, then open a blank database and ignore any warning messages.\nWhen running in normal mode, PAMGuard writes settings to a table in the database and Viewer mode will read the settings back from the database. This ensures that the PAMGuard configuration you are viewing will be compatible with the data in the database.\nFor more information on how to begin your analysis go to Click Viewer Overview.\n\n\nData Scrolling\nIt is not possible to load entire large data sets into the Viewer since the program will run out of memory. On the other hand, it is inefficient to continually be loading data for display whenever the operator scrolls back or forth by a few seconds.\nThe PAMGuard viewer therefore uses a sophisticated double scroll system in which an outer scroller controls the loading of data into memory and an inner scroller moves through that data. For example, when viewing clicks with the click detector, an operator will probably want to load about 30 minutes of data at a time, but may only view minutes or seconds of those loaded data as they make a detailed analysis of the clicks.\nExactly which options are available on individual displays with PAMGuard can vary. However, the functionality will generally be a subset of that in the click detector:\n\nThe main part of the scroller (taking up most of the space on the left) is an ordinary scroll bar which allows you to navigate through loaded data. To the right are a pair of blue arrow buttons with a downward arrow button between them. The blue buttons are used to load the next section of data (e.g. to jump forward or backward half an hour).\nClick on the downward pointing arrow to display other options:\n\nOptions include the start time of the loaded data, the time period of the loaded data and the percentage movement forward or backward when the blue arrows are pressed. (In the example above, 30 minutes of data are loaded, and there is a 75% step size, so the blue arrows would move forward or backward by 22.5 minutes).\nRight click on the downward arrow for an option to couple all scrollers in all PAMGuard modules.\nThe number in the right hand box shows the duration of data actually displayed in the window (120 seconds in the example). This can be changed by typing a new number or by using the tiny up and down arrow in the right of the edit box.\nTo assist in navigating through large data sets, the Data Map will always be added to the PAMGuard model when operating in Viewer mode.\nPrevious: Normal Operation\nNext: Mixed Mode Operation",

For example, if you were using a 4 - 20mA depth sensor which had a nominal maximum depth of 100m, the values would be calculated as follows:\nThe first value is simply the 4mA offset on the reading, so set it to -0.04\nThe second value is the range of the sensor (100m) divided by the range of the input device (16mA) so set it to 100/0.016 = 6250.0.\nThe third value can be left at zero\nNow consider the consequences of finding that there is a 3.2m offset in the depth readings. You could recalculate the first two constants, which would become -0.0045 and 6250. Much more simple will be to adjust the third parameter by the measured offset, leaving the first two alone, i.e. the three parameters become -.004, 6250 and 3.2.\nIf you require a non-linear calibration, please contact the PAMGuard development team.\nPrevious: Configuration\nNext: Display",

    "text": "Overview\nThe Array Accelerometer module can be used to measure the pitch and roll of a hydrophone array.\nWith simple line arrays, knowing the precise orientation of the array is probably not necessary. However as more users move towards using multi-channel, multi-dimensional hydrophone arrays in order to determine animal locations in three dimensions, knowing the orientation of array sections becomes increasingly important.\nThree axis accelerometers are readily available at low cost (most of us probably have one in our phone and another in our camera). The PAMGuard Array Accelerometer module has been designed to specifically to work with the Analog Devices ADXL335. Users who don’t wish to, or don’t have the capability to incorporate surface mount IC’s into their hydrophone designs can use the EVAL-ADXL335Z Evaluation Kit. These are readily available from electronic component suppliers worldwide.\nThe system currently only works with MeasurementComputing data acquisition cards (www.mccdaq.com) but may be extended to support other devices in the future. It is possible to use the same MeasurementComputing card with the Array Accelerometer module and the Hydrophone Depth Module\nPith and roll information is passed to the hydrophone array manager which makes it available to other PAMGuard modules as required.\nhydrophone array configuration dialog.\nA small side panel shows a graph of recent pitch and roll history.\n\n\n\nAccelerometer side panel\n\n\n\nDatabase output\nBoth the raw voltage data and the calculated pitch and roll are written to the database.

You can then configure the card using the sound acquisition dialog shown below.\n\n\n\nSound Acquisition Dialog\n\n\n\nUsing a single National Instruments device\nMake sure that “Use Multiple DAQ boards” is not selected and choose the device you wish to use from the “Master Device” drop down list (there may be several National Instruments devices installed on a single system).\n\nTerminal Configuration\nThe terminal configuration you select will depend on how your hydrophone and pre-amplifiers have been connected to the National Instruments device. Detailed information on the four available configurations and how to use them is given in the National Instruments help files which should be installed on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal Configuration\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nReferenced single ended\nSignals are referenced to a common ground (the AIGND) terminal\n\n\nNon-referenced single ended\nSignals are referenced to a common terminal (AISENSE) which is not necessarily the same as ground\n\n\nDifferential\nDifferential input signals are used NB. This may halve the number of available channels\n\n\nPseudo Differential\nDifferential input, but one side of the differential input is tied to ground via a resistor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample rate and number of channels\nSet the sample rate in Hz and the number of channels. This must be within the limits of the device. With most devices, the sample rate must be reduced for higher channel numbers, e.g. a PCI-6250 device can sample two channels at 500 kHz per channels but can only sample four channels at 250 kHz per channel.\n\n\nHardware channels\nSelect the hardware channels you wish to read. Note that it’s not possible to read the same channel more than once.\nWhichever hardware channels are selected, software channel numbering in PAMGuard will always be 0, 1, 2, etc…\n\n\nRange\nThe drop down list of ranges for each channel will be populated with a list of available input ranged for the selected device.\nSelect the range you wish to use. Note that the Peak to peak voltage range in the Calibration panel at the bottom of the dialog will automatically set to the range of the first channel. Values used in calculations of sound pressure levels in PAMGuard will use the correct values for each channel.\nIf the range list is empty, then it is likely that the device you have selected is not working correctly\n\n\nUsing multiple National Instruments devices\nIf you require more channels or higher sample rates than can be achieved using a single National Instruments device, it is possible to simultaneously sample from multiple devices. e.g. you could use two USB-6251 devices to sample four channels at 500 kHz sample rate per channel. In principle, you can use as many different devices as you like. In practice you will be limited by the number of PCI slots and USB ports on your computer and by the rate at which PAMGuard can process the data\nTo use multiple devices, check the “Use multiple DAQ boards” box on the dialog. The ‘Master Device’ selection will no longer be available and individual devices should be selected as shown below.\n\n\n\nSound Acquisition Dialog\n\n\n\nDevice and Channel Ordering\nAll Channels on each device must me grouped together as shown in the above example which reads channels 0 and 1 on Dev4, then channels 0 and 1 on Dev7. Reading Dev4 Channel 0 / Dev 7 Channel 0 / Dev 4 Channel 1 / Dev 7 Channel 1 is would not be allowed.\n\n\nIMPORTANT Timing information when using multiple devices\nWhen using a single device all timing (i.e. how often the device acquires samples) is taken from an internal clock in that one device. These are generally very accurate and the number of samples you expect to acquire in a given time interval will be very close to that time interval x the sample rate. However, if multiple devices are used, and each device acquires samples based on it’s own internal clock, the exact number of samples acquired by each device will gradually differ. For example, even if the clocks were 0.0001% accurate, after just two seconds sampling at 500 kHz sample rate, one device would have acquired one more sample than the other device. Small timing differences based on sample counts between signals arriving on multiple channels would therefore rapidly become meaningless.\nWhen using multiple devices, the internal clock in the first (or master) device is therefore sent to the other devices which use the master clock signal in preference to their own internal clock.\nYou must physically connect the clock signal from the master device to the other devices yourself: Using a single wire, connect the PFI 1 terminal of the master device to the PFI 1 terminals of all the other devices (yes, it is PFI 1 to PFI 1).\nIf you fail to do this, the other devices will not acquire data and you will continually receive the message “NIDaq Error DAQmxReadAnalogF64 code -200284 Measurements: Some or all of the samples requested have not yet been acquired …”\nPrevious: Audio File Folders\nNext: SAIL Daq Cards",

    "text": "SoundTrap recorders from Ocean Instruments store data in proprietary files called SUD files. See SoundTrap documentation for information on how to extract SUD files from SoundTrap recorders.\nEarlier versions of PAMGuard required you to ‘inflate’ the SUD files into standard wav audio files using the SoundTrap Host software before they could be processed.\nThe current version of PAMGuard no longer requires this since it can read data directly from the SUD files.\nInflating SUD files to WAV files generally required between 3 and 5 times as much disk space and could also take a fair amount of time, so not inflating will save both!\n\nSUD Index Files\nTo efficiently navigate SUD files, PAMGuard makes a map of each file and stores it in a new file in the same folder as the original SUD file. The index files have the same name as the original file, but end with .sudx. The index files are about 2.5% of the size of the original SUD files. When processing SUD files it is therefore important that a) the drive containing the SUD files is less than 95% full and b) that the system running PAMGuard has write access to the folder containing the SUD files.\n\n\nSUD File Times\nThe name of each SUD file contains the device serial number and a timestamp (data and time) in the form YYMMDDhhmmss. Note that these time stamps are in local time. When processing the file, PAMGuard will extract a UTC timestamp from within each SUD file and apply the UTC time to the data. you may therefore notice that the times of binary files and database entries differ from the times in the file names.\n\n\nMixing SUD and WAV files\nIf a SUD file and a WAV file with the same name are in the same folder, then PAMGuard will ignore the SUD file and process the WAV file. Note that in this case, PAMGuard will be unable to extract any metadata from the SUD file and will not extract SoundTrap Click Detections (see below).\n\n\nSoundTrap Click Detector\nIf you are using the SoundTrap build in click detector (see SoundTrap manuals) then the SUD files will also contain detected clicks.\nSee the help page for the SoundTrap Click Detector for information on how to get these clicks from the SUD files into PAMGuard.",

    "text": "Algorithm Dialog Tabs\nBoth the Basic Frequency Domain and MVDR Beamformer Algorithms have the same user-configurable options. The dialog window has 2 tabs: Individual Beams and Beamogram. The user is able to define either individual beams, a beamogram, or both, depending on the output desired.\n\n\nConfiguring Individual Beams\nIndividual beams can be created to focus the beamformer algorithms in a specific look direction. The output data of a beam can be used with any module that accepts fft data, such as a spectrogram or the Whistle & Moan detector. When selecting a beam to use, the ‘beam number’ is used in place of the channel number that is normally specified in a dialog.\n\n\nArray Information: The type of array as defined by the channels in this group, and the corresponding valid angle ranges. There are three possible array types: Linear, Planar and Volumetric.\n\nLinear arrays position all the hydrophones in a single line (1-dimensional). This type of array has both left/right and up/down ambiguity. The primary angle is defined in the direction of the main array axis (Y-axis, as given in the Array Manager) and is valid from 0� (positive Y) to 180� (negative Y). The secondary angle is undefined.\nPlanar arrays position the hydrophones in two different axes (2-dimensional). This type of array resolves one of the ambiguities of the linear array, but not the other. For example, a planar array with both axis in the horizontal plane (X and Y) would be able to distinguish between left and right of the array, but not above or below. In that case the primary angle is defined relative to the main axis (positive Y) and valid from -180� to 180�. The secondary angle is measured perpendicular to the plane, and valid from 0� (in the same plane) to 90� (directly above/below).\nVolumetric arrays position the hydrophones in all three axes (3-dimensional). This type of array has no ambiguity. The primary angle is defined relative to the main axis (positive Y) and valid from -180� to 180�. The secondary angle is defined relative to the perpendicular axis (positive Z) and valid from -90� to 90�.\n\nList of Individual Beams: A list of the currently defined beams. Selecting one of the beams will highlight it and display the beam pattern in the chart to the right (if all beam patterns are being displayed in the chart, the selected beam pattern will be shown in orange).\nBeam Generation Tools: To create a new beam, type in the primary angle and secondary angle, select the window type, and press the Add Beam button. Pressing the Delete Beam button will delete whichever beam is currently selected in the table above. Pressing the Create Default Beams button will automaticall create n beams, where n is equal to the number of channels in this group. The beams will be evenly spaced throughout the valid primary angle range.\nBeam Pattern chart: a chart displaying the beam pattern of the currently selected beam, in orange. If all beams are being displayed, the other beams will be appear in grey. The beam pattern shows the gain as a function of primary angle, at the specified secondary angle and frequency. The gain is an indication of the angles at which constructive/destructive interference will occur between the channels.\nBeam Configuration Tools: tools to allow the user to modify the beam parameters and immediately see the effect in the chart above. The parameters are applied only to the beam selected in the table to the left, which will be shown in orange in the chart. Checking the Display All Beam Patterns box will display all of the beams in the chart, with the selected beam in orange and the remaining beams in grey.\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Beamogram\nInstead of creating individual beams to identify signals originating from a specific direction, a beamogram can be used to sweep an entire range of directions. The resultant output is a ‘heat-map’ of the amplitude of the signal versus primary and secondary angles. The output can be shown on a User Display tab by selecting New Beamformer Display.\nA beamogram can be considered as a great number of individual beams, combined into a single output. As such, it is much more computationally-intensive and care should be taken when selecting the parameters below. Small step sizes and large angle ranges (i.e. fine resolution scanning) will require appropriate processor speed and memory.\n\n\nArray Information: The type of array as defined by the channels in this group. Valid angle ranges are given in the appropriate sections below. There are three possible array types: Linear, Planar and Volumetric. See the Individual Beams Array Information section for details of each.\nCheckbox indicating whether or not to calculate the beamogram.\nPrimary angle parameters: the minimum, maximum and step size to use when sweeping the primary angle. The direction and valid range of the primary angle depends on the type of array. See the Individual Beams Array Information section for details.\nSecondary angle parameters: the minimum, maximum and step size to use when sweeping the secondary angle. The direction and valid range of the secondary angle depends on the type of array. See the Individual Beams Array Information section for details.\nThe Frequency range: the beamogram requires much more processing-power than individual beams. In order to speed up the calculations and prevent memory overflow problems, it is recommended that the frequency range over which the beamogram is calculated be limited to the frequencies containing the signals of interest.\n\nPrevious: Beamformer Settings\nNext: Beamformer Output",

    "text": "Time-domain beamforming uses streams of audio input from multiple sensor channels, adds different time delays/advances to these audio streams, and then differentially weighs and sums them, resulting in one or more acoustic beams. These beams will be most sensitive in only one direction, the direction providing constructive interference. They will suppress noise coming from other directions, destructive interference, thereby improving signal-to-noise ratios in the desired direction. In effect, a beamformer is a spatial filter, filtering out all arriving signals except those in the direction of interest.\nAn alternative interpretation is that beamforming converts data from a multi-sensor/multi-channel array into data from a single directional receiver located at the array phase center. The direction in which this directional receiver is pointed can be changed via time delays and advances. Time-delay-and-sum beamforming is a phase-coherent array processing method. Other phase-coherent beamformers operate in the frequency domain, after taking Fourier transforms of the input time series data, phase delaying/advancing, weighting, and summing, and outputting one or more narrowband beams that can be integrated over a frequency band of interest for broadband signals.\nMore advanced algorithms (e.g., adaptive beamforming) can be used to electronically steer the beams under specified optimization criteria (e.g., minimize the beamformer’s output variance under the constraint of unity gain in the desired look direction), allowing the user to effectively look or listen in a specific direction while minimizing the interference from noise and sounds in other directions. These data-adaptive beamforming approaches are effective for maximizing array gain in the presence of interfering noise sources, such as airgun operations or vessel noise.\n\nImplementation\nPAMGuard’s Beamformer module offers two different types of frequency-domain beamforming algorithms: Basic (aka Conventional or Bartlett), and Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (aka MVDR). The Conventional beamformer uses a fixed set of weightings to combine signals from different channels. The MVDR uses uses an adaptive weighting scheme which seeks to minimize the variance of the input signal. The MVDR is more processor-intensive, but may result in better noise reduction and signal amplification.\nThe beamformer module can be configured two different ways. Individual beams can be defined, which point in a specific direction. Output from these beams is FFT data which can be used as input to other modules and processes. A beamogram can also be configured, which sweeps over an area/volume to reveal bearing angles from which higher amplitude signals are originating.\nNext: Configuring the module",

    "text": "Two main types of filter are available in PAMGuard. IIRF (Infinite Impulse Response) Filters are generally preferred since they are faster than the alternative FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter types. However there may be circumstances when you prefer to use an FIR filter, particularly if an unusual filter response is required (for instance, one mimicking the hearing response of an animal, or with multiple ‘notches’ to remove noise).\nButterworth filters have a flat response over frequencies in the pass band, so are preferred for any processes that will be making noise measurements downstream of the filter.\nChebyshev filters have a slightly better attenuation, but at the expense of some ripple in the pass band.\nBoth types of filter can be configured from within PAMGuard’s filter design panel. This is used in the stand alone Filters Module, but also appears in the configuration for several other modules, including the click detector, the Decimator and some noise measurement modules.",

Note that these should be greater than 0 and less than half of the sample rate.\nAlso set the filter order - this controls how steeply the filter will attenuate close to the cut off frequencies. High order filters use more processing power than low order ones and can also have a long impulse response which can reduce the time resolution of transient signals. Note that for FIR filters, the filter order parameter that you enter is actually the log base 2 of the length of the actual filter, i.e. a filter order of 6 will generate 64 tap filer, 7 a 128 tap filter, etc.\nFor Chebychev filters, you can also set the amount of ripple in the passband and for FIR filters, you can set ‘gamma’ which alters the rate of filter attenuation verses ripple in the stop band.\nFor IIR filters, in the lower left part of the dialog, you will see a pole-zero diagram. For FIR filters, this is replaced by the filter taps, or impulse response of the filter.\n\n\n\nFilters Settings\n\n\nIf you have selected an FIR Arbitrary filter, the dialog will change to show a list of frequencies and gains.\n\n\n\nFilters Settings\n\n\nIt’s currently only possible to update this list by creating and editing a text file, which should be a comma separated list of frequencies and gains, e.g.\n0, -80\n5000, -80\n6000, -40\n7000, 0\n11000, -5\n13000, -10\n15000, 0\n17000, 0\n17000, -30\n18000, -80\n24000, -80\nUse the import button to import the values from your text file\n\n\nBode Plot\nThe filter dialog displays a bode plot (attenuation verses frequency) for the chosen filter parameters. You can show this on either a logarithmic of linear frequency scale. Double clicking the amplitude axis will change the range of the amplitude scale.\n\n\nPole-Zero or Impulse Response Plot\nIn the lower left corner you will see either a plot of the filters Impulse Response, or a Pole-Zero plot (IIR Filters only). The Impulse response of a filter is the signal that will come out of a filter if a single unit sample is input to the filter, i.e. a 1 followed by an infinite number of zeros. It is important to understand since it shows how a filter will distort a waveform, generally delaying it, and elongating it in time. Particularly for very short sounds, such as dolphin echolocation clicks, the waveform you see in the click detector may be a function of any filters you’ve included in the detector as much as it is a function of the sound coming out of the animal.\nPole Zero plots are a part of IIR Filter design, but understanding them is probably not important to most PAMGuard users. When designiing IIR Filters, you can switch between pole-zero and impulse responde plots by right clicking on the display.",

    "text": "This module allows you to measure noise in frequency bands of Third Octave, Deci-Decade, Octave, Decade, or bands you type in yourself. These measurements are compatible with the ANSI Standard ANSI S1.11-2004 American National Standard Specification for Octave-Band and Fractional-Octave-Band Analog and Digital Filters.\nThe module requires FFT data as input. It works out which FFT data belong to which of the defined frequency bands, and as data arrive, sums the FFT data for each band. This means that at low frequencies, where the frequency bands your measuring are probably smaller, you start to lose resolution in frequency. If you want to measure noise at very low frequencies, you’ll either have to use a very long FFT length, or switch to using the Noise Band Monitor.\n\nCreating the module\nFrom the File&gt;Add modules&gt;Sound Processing menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select ” Noise Monitor”. Enter a name for the new module and press Ok.\n\n\nConfiguring the module\nTo configure the module, open the settings dialog from the Detection&gt;“your module name” menu:\n\nFor standard bands: Third Octave, Deci Decade, Octave, and Decade, just click the appropriate check box to the right of the dialog. These buttons will automatically generate as many bands as possible depending on the frequency resolution of the FFT data and the Nyquist frequency. The minimum frequency is calculated such that the lowest frequency band spans a minimum of two frequency bins in the FFF data. Bands will be centred at multiples of 1000Hz.\nIf you require other bands, for example, decade bands with edges at 100, 1000, 10000Hz, etc., you can enter these manually by pressing the Add Other Bands button. Remember that it’s not going to give accurate results if you enter band frequencies that are a fraction of the FFT data’s frequency resolution. If you require measurements at lower frequencies you’ll have to use a long FFT length, or decimate the audio data to a lower frequency.\n\nOutput Interval\nEnter the interval between measurements in seconds. Note that you may not get measurements at exactly these intervals because the start times of the FFT data may not like exactly on second boundaries.\n\n\nNumber of measures in interval\nGenerally, it’s best to select the ‘Use all FFT data’ button, so that all data in all FFT’s in the selected time interval will be included in noise measurement. However, if you’re intervals are very long and you want to reduce processing load by only using a random sample of the data, you can set a lower number of measurement to take from that interval.\n\n\nInput FFT Length\nIf you want your output times aligned nicely on second boundaries, you can use a FFT Hop, in the FFT module that is an exact factor of the sample rate. With the modern FFT algorithm used by PAMGuard, it’s also generally OK to pick an FFT length that is not a power of 2. e.g. if you have data sampled at 384kHz, and want noise measurements right down to 10Hz, you could set up an FFT with a length of 384000 samples, and a hop of 192000. This would use more processing power than an FFT length of 262144 samples (the nearest exact power of 2), but will probably be OK.\nPrevious: Overview\nNext: Filter Bank Method",

The pulse will end when the measured levels drop to lower then the maximum measurement within the pulse minus the threshold.

    "text": "Many of the PAMGuard detectors set detection thresholds automatically as a function of background noise. Loud sounds from airguns can upset this automatic threshold setting. It is of course extremely unpleasant listening on headphones when airguns are firing nearby and airgun sounds may even pose a risk to the operators hearing.\nDuring automatic threshold setting, a period of zero signal can upset threshold levels almost as much as a period of too much signal for some detector types\nThe seismic veto module detects the airgun pulse automatically using a simple in-band energy detector operating on spectrogram data. When the signal level exceeds some threshold, that period of sound is either taken out and set to zero, or replaced with randomly generated noise with the same spectral properties as measured in the signal prior to the airgun pulse. The time window of vetoed data can be set to continue after the signal has fallen below threshold to ensure the end of the pulse is discarded. It can also be configured to start the veto before the onset of the pulse (this is achieved by delaying the signal slightly in an internal buffer).\nThe seismic veto module has two output streams, the first containing vetoed FFT data and the second containing vetoed raw audio data. Other PAMGuard modules can subscribe to the appropriate output of the seismic veto module and operate as normal, but without the loud airgun sounds.\n\n\n\nSeismic Veto Data Model\n\n\nThe figure above shows a simple PAMGuard configuration with the output of the seismic veto connected to a sound playback module, a click detector and a whistle detector. The figure below shows spectrograms and waveforms of data before and after the seismic veto module.\n\n\n\nSeismic Veto Spectrograms\n\n\nA veto can be inserted anywhere in the PAMGuard data model where there is FFT / Spectrogram data.\nNext: Seismic Veto Configuration",

Drag the slider to the required cut off frequency and the filter will automatically adjust.\n\n\nEnvelope Tracing\nMany cetacean echolocation clicks are too high frequency to be audible to humans. However, it is possible to hear these sounds by listening to their outline, or “envelope” which is at a much lower frequency then the main waveform and is generally audible.\nThe envelope tracer works by first high pass or band pass filtering the data, then all negative values in the waveform are set positive before the “rectified” waveform is low pass filtered to smooth it out. The two filters can be adjusted from the drop down menu accessible from the small arrow by the slider.\nThe operator can select how much of the raw audio and how much of the envelope traced signal are mixed together using the slider. This makes it possible to simultaneously listen to sounds, such as dolphin whistles, which are in the human audio band and high frequency click trains from species such as harbour porpoise.\n\n\nSpeed\n**\nNote that this feature will be hidden and disabled when processing data in real time.\n**\nWhen processing data from file, simulated data, or when using the PAMGuard Viewer, it is possible to adjust the playback speed. Drag the slider to the desired speed. When adjusting the playback speed, the frequency of the sounds will change. e.g. when playing at half the true speed, the frequency of sounds will halve.\nWhen speed adjustments are made, the selected sample rate of the output device remains the same. The speed change is affected by decimating or upsampling the audio data.\n\n\nGain\nAttenuate or amplify the data.\nNote that you should also check the sound settings on your computer. Increasing the gain in PAMGuard to a high level when the system’s sound card volume is turned right down may lead to signal distortion, so make sure the sound on the computer is turned up first.\nPrevious: Sound Output Configuration",

There is an option to have files written to separate sub folders of the root directory, a new folder being created each day.\nWAVE (WAV), AU and AIFF (AIF) formats are currently supported with bit depths of either 16 or 24. The bit depth should ideally match the bit depth of the sound acquisition system. Most acquisition systems are 16 bit. Exceptions are some audio files and some ASIO sound cards. Note that while the bit depth is correctly read from sound files, it is not possible to read the bit depth from ASIO devices so they will report a bit depth of 24 bits even if they are only reading 16. you should consult the devices manual to check for yourself.\n\n\nMaximum File Lengths\nSet the maximum length of single files either as a length in seconds and / or a size in Megabytes. Although you are likely to store files on hard drives, it is generally sensible to limit the size of single files such that a single file will fit on a writable CD or DVD. Never let files become larger than 2 Gigabytes since some systems will be unable to read them. (In principle the maximum size of a WAV file is 4 Gigabytes, however we have found that some software will be unable to read files larger 2 Gigabytes).\n\nRound file start times\nWherever possible file start times will be controlled to start on hour / 10 minute boundaries, etc.\nPrevious: Sound Recorder Overview\nNext: Sound Recorder Operation",

Some may make more sense than others, for example, if you were to trigger off data from the acquisition module, alarms would fire several times a second whenever PAMGuard is running. The choice of alarm trigger is however your’s, so chose wisely !\nDepending on the data source, it may have additional options. For example, if you select the click detector it will allow you to select the types of click which will trigger an alarm. This uses the same system of Data Selectors that has been developed for the PAMGuard displays and will automatically include options for detection groups and data annotations.\n\n\nAlarm Count\nThe type of alarm count you select will depend on the type of trigger you are using. Three types are available:\n\nSimple Counts\nScored Values\nSingle Measurements\n\nNote that not all count types can be used with all types of data. In future releases we hope to automatically restrict the count types available for particular data sources, but for now, you’ll have to use your intelligence and pick a rational combination.\n\nSimple Counts\nSelecting this option causes the alarm module to simply count up the number of data which arrive from a data source. For example, it could be used to trigger an alarm if a certain number of whistles were to arrive in a given time interval.\n\n\nScored Values\nThis is slightly more sophisticated than the simple counts and would generally be used with a data source such as a noise measurement where you’re more interested in the value of the noise measurement rather than the fact that there has been a measurement.\nHow scored values are added may depend on the data source.\n\n\nSingle Measurements\nAs the name suggests, this is suitable for assessing single measurements, such as noise levels where the value of a single measurement is of interest, not the fact that a measurement has been made.\n\n\n\nCount Time\nThis is the number of seconds to count for. This option is not used with Single Measurements.\n\n\nAmber and Red Counts\nThese are the thresholds at which amber and red alarms are triggered.\nFor noise alarms, they are likely to be the noise level in Decibels. For detections, you should enter the number of detections required to trigger the alarm.\n\n\nMinimum Gap\nAlarm status messages are sent every time the alarm status changes. However if the alarm remains in the same state and more data are arriving which continually trigger that state, alarm messages might start firing thick and fast. Entering a value of a few seconds here will limit the number of alarm triggers. For example, you would want to use this on a click based alarm so that if hundreds of clicks were being detected every minute, you would get occasional reminders of the alarm status, but not one for every click.\nPrevious: Alarms Overview\nNext: Alarms Actions",

The binary storage system stores PAMGuard output in a proprietary data format which is simple and efficient and can handle any type of data.\nData stored using the binary store can be reviewed with the PAMGuard viewer. It is also possible to open the binary files using your own software written in other programming languages such as Matlab or R.\n\nAdding a Binary Storage module\nFrom the File&gt;Add Modules&gt;Utilities menu select ‘Binary Storage’ to add binary storage to your configuration.\n\n\nConfiguring the Binary Store\nTo configure the binary store, go to the File&gt;Binary Storage… menu to open the Binary Storage dialog.\n\nSelect the folder where you want to store the data and optionally set the other three options.\nStoring data in folders arranged by date can help with data backup and archiving.\nSome PAMGuard detectors make additional measures of background noise. These can be stored either with the binary data in the pgdf files or in separate pgnf files (see below). The former has the advantage of creating fewer files, the latter may make it easier to load and process noise data (e.g. to assess detector performance) in R or Matlab.\nAutomatically starting new files is important in order that individual files do not get excessively large.\nThe binary store can start new files at fixed time intervals, when files reach a certain size or both (i.e. which ever condition occurs first).\n\n\nOutput Files\nOutput files are identified by a long name which contains the module type, the module name, the datablock name, the date and the time. e.g. Clicks from a Click Detector called “Porpoise Detector” will have a name like “Click_Detector_Porpoise_Detector_Clicks_20100331_142400.pgdf”\n\npgdf Files\npgdf files are the main files which contain the binary data. All pgdf files have a common header and footer structure (i.e. the data at the start and at the end of each file). Individual units of data are however different for each module.\npgdf files can contain more than one type of data. In particular, some detectors also include regular measurements of background noise in their binary output.\n\n\npgnf Files\nSome detectors (currently the Click detector the Whistle and Moan detector and the GPL detector) make and store measures of background noise. These can be important in assessing detector performance. The background data can either be stored with the detection data in the pgdf files or written to separate pgnf files. In either case, the stored data are the same, it’s a choice of fewer files or whether you want to be able to access noise data relatively quickly without having to load all binary data as well.\n\n\npgdx Files\npgdx files are indexing files. They contain headers and footers which are identical to those in the pgdf files, but no data. pgdx files speed up indexing processes at the start of a PAMGuard viewer session.\n\n\npsfx Files\npsfx files contain PAMGuard configuration data. These are basically the same data are as stored in the standard PAMGuard configuration files, but wrapped with a date and other information.\nOne of these is written each time PAMGuard is started, providing a permanent record of PAMGuard settings. psfx files can be loaded into the PAMGuard Viewer from the viewer data map or reloaded as with any other configuration file.\nNext: Matlab and R interfaces",

MySQL is a server based database which is much harder to move between computers but can better handle multiple users accessing the same data simultaneously. So if you’re in the field collecting data on a laptop, you’re almost definitely better off with SQLite. On the other hand, if you have the technical know how and want a managed database system back at the lab, you might consider MySQL as a solution.\nThe latest PAMGuard versions contain excellent facilities for moving data between different database systems.\n\n\nAdding tables to the database\nPAMGuard will automatically add the necessary tables to your database.\nIf a new detector module is added to PAMGuard at any point, the database module is notified and will add the additional tables required.\nIf a module is removed and a table is no longer needed, that table will be left in the database unaltered.\nShould the definition of a table change due to the new release of a module which outputs additional information, any additional columns required will be automatically added to existing tables.\n\n\nOther alterations\nYou may add other tables and queries to the database without affecting PAMGuard operation. Additional tables will be ignored by PAMGuard.\nYou can even add additional columns to tables which are used by PAMGuard and these additional columns will also be ignored.\nHowever, you should not change the format of any existing columns and do not create relationships between tables which may not always be satisfied or PAMGuard may be unable to write data to the database.",

Provide a serial number for the Instrument Id if you can, otherwise any name that you can associate with a specific device.\n2) Hydrophone Diagram\nProvides a graphical display of the hydrophone positions within the array.\n3) Array Configuration\nLists the individual streamers and hydrophone elements making up the array.\n4) Channel Configuration\nLists the software channels associated with a Sound Acquisition Module..\n5) Environment\nLists environmental parameters.\n6) Array Management\nAllows you to create, import, export and rename different hydrophone arrays.\n\nInstrument Information\nThis is for book keeping purposes only and will help you to remember exactly how data were collected when you come back to this dataset in years to come.\n\n\nHydrophone Diagram\nThis part of the dialog is for information purposes only and there are no configuration options. Hydrophone positions are shown relative to the reference coordinate and heading. Physical hydrophone numbers are shown in black. Software channel numbers are shown in red. It is possible, if no software channel is connected to a particular hydrophone that the software channel will be absent for some hydrophones.\nCoordinate Frame\nFor towed systems it is assumed that the vessel’s GPS is at (x,y) = (0,0) and is travelling in the forward (increasing) y direction. Consequently, for an array towed astern of the vessel, y coordinates are generally negative numbers. For a single array in the centre line of the vessel with a centrally mounted GPS, all x coordinates will be zero, etc. For display purposes, depth is entered as a positive number, however developers should be aware that within the PAMGuard data model, the positive z coordinate is upwards, therefore depths are stored as negative numbers.\nFor fixed locations, the diagram is relative to the heading set for that mooring, which should be an angle relative to True North. If no heading is set, the angles are relative to True North.\n\n\nArray Configuration\nThis lists the individual streamers and hydrophone elements making up an array.\nSelecting an array\nIf more than one array is available within a configuration, a particular array may be selected using the drop down list. Note that only one array is loaded at any one time.\nHydrophone Streamers\nIf you are using a towed array you should define one or more streamers which will be shown in the Hydrophone Streamers table.\nA Streamer is used to refer to any cluster of hydrophones which share a common origin, e.g. a towed array or a buoy of some sort would normally be entered as a single streamer containing one or more hydrophones.\nUse the Add, Edit and Delete buttons to add, edit and delete streamers. When you add or edit a streamer the Streamer Dialog will appear which allows you to set up the streamer coordinates and other properties.\nYou will not be able to remove the last streamer. You will also only be able to delete a streamer if no hydrophones are associated with that streamer.\nHydrophone Elements\nThis area lists individual hydrophone elements. Each hydrophone is given a unique Id which is referred to in the Channel Configuration section and is also associated with a single hydrophone streamer.\nUse the Add, Edit and Delete buttons to add, edit and delete hydrophones. When you add or edit a hydrophone the Hydrophone Dialog will appear.\n\n\nChannel Configuration\nThe first stage of most PAM processes is to acquire the sound with a digitiser (e.g. a sound card) or some other Sound Acquisition module within the PAMGuard model.\nIt is possible for PAMGuard to operate with more than one Sound Acquisition module and a one-to-many relationship can exist between hydrophones and data channels within the sound acquisition modules. For instance, a single multi-element array may contain both low and high frequency hydrophones, some of which are connected to a low frequency digitiser and other high frequency hydrophones.\nThe drop down list at the top of the Channel Configuration panel will list all Sound Acquisition Modules currently instantiated in the PAMGuard data model. Information on a single Sound Acquisition module is displayed at any one time.\nBy default, when a sound acquisition module is created, it will map it’s channels 1 to 1 to the PAMGuard array. To change these mappings, select the software channel of interest in the Channel Configuration panel and press ‘Change hydrophone’ and select the hydrophone you want to relate to that software channel.\nOther parameters displayed in the list area of the Channel Configuration panel are set in the Sound Acquisition dialog and are for information only.\n\n\nEnvironment\nThis currently contains the speed of sound in sea water and an estimate of the error on the speed of sound measurement.\n(It is possible that future releases of PAMGuard will allow entry of a sound speed profile here ).\n\n\nArray Management\nWhen you have finished with the PAMGuard Hydrophone Array dialog, press the OK button.\nTo exit without saving changes, press Cancel.\nOther buttons perform the following actions:\nNew Array: Creates a new PAMGuard hydrophone array\nCopy: Copies the currently loaded array\nRename: Renames the currently loaded array\nImport: Imports a hydrophone array from a PAMGuard Array File (.paf)\nExport: Exports the currently selected array to a PAMGuard Array File (.paf)\nDelete: Deletes the currently selected array.\nPrevious: Overview\nNext: Streamer Dialog",

    "text": "A streamer in PAMGuard is a collection or cluster of one or more hydrophones that are physically connected and are expected to move together. The name ‘streamer’ is a bit of a misnomer these days. It comes from early PAMGuard versions when we were mostly dealing with towed hydrophone arrays, but the general concept applies to a wide range of equipment. Things that should be considered as a streamer include towed arrays, mooring buoys, fixed autonomous sensors, drifters, etc.\nIn many circumstances, there is flexibility as to how many streamers you have and how many hydrophones. For example, if you’d put out ten moorings and knew the GPS locations of each, enter them as a streamer each, with one hydrophone per streamer. If you have a very long array with multiple active sections, you may want to enter this as a separate streamer for each section so that you can use separate array sensors for each section to better determine the hydrophone positions.\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe Streamer name is for information purposes only.\n\n\nReference Position\nStreamer locations can be referenced to either the “Ships GPS Data” or to “Fixed location (moorings and buoys)”. If GPS data is selected then the system will automatically connect to data from the GPS Module. If a fixed location is selected, then additional options will appear allowing you to enter a reference Latitude and Longitude.\n\nTo change the position, use the menu on the button to the right of the displayed location. It is possible to enter a new value manually, take the current GPS position or to paste in the last location clicked on the PAMGuard map.\n\n\nHydrophone Locator Method\nTwo methods are available for calculating true hydrophone coordinates from the reference position. These are the “Threading Streamer” locator and the “Straight / Rigid Streamer” locator.\nThe Threading system is most applicable to towed hydrophone systems referenced to ship GPS data. It assumes that the streamer cable exactly follows the track of the vessel as it goes round corners. However, for hydrophones mounted rigidly on the hull of a vessel it would be more sensible to use the Straight / Rigid method.\nIf the reference position is a fixed location, then it only makes sense to use the Straight / Rigid method.\n\n\nHydrophone Coordinates\nEnter the hydrophone coordinates in metres relative to the reference position.\nAlso enter estimates of the errors on those coordinates.\n\n\nOrientation data\nFor GPS referenced locations, if these values are not null, they will override heading values from the GPS data. If they are null, then the GPS values will be used. Some users are starting to collect orientation data for hydrophones which can give a more accurate position than relying on the threading hydrophone model. See the Analog Array Sensors module information to see how you can hook up sensors to the array manager. If you wish to use other sensors, then it’s possible to program new PAMGuard modules which will integrate directly into the array management system. An example of this is the RION Compass plug-in module which reads a digital compass through a serial port. If you’re interested in adding additional sensors of your own, looking at the source code for the RION module is a good place to start, or contact the PAMGuard team.\n\n\nInterpolation\nThings sometimes move ! As we start to incorporate sensors into our arrays, it will be necessary to chose how to pick a position from a list of evolving positions over time.\nThese options tell the system to take the latest value entered by the user, to interpolate between values bracketing the time of an event or to use the values immediately preceding an event.\nPrevious: Array Configuration\nNext: Hydrophone Dialog",

Critical Monitoring and Non-Critical Monitoring statuses are included by default. The Critical Monitoring state is intended for periods of active mitigation monitoring, while the Non-Critical Monitoring state is intended for periods of monitoring that are not required for compliance or prior to a critical monitoring period.\nIt is recommended that Quick Tests be performed during non-critical monitoring when possible. Random Drills can be implemented and edited throughout monitoring periods.\n\nThe current operations status can be selected from the drop-down text box. In order to properly log a status change to the database, a selection must be made from the text box even if the correct status is already displayed. When a status is selected, it will be shown in the Operations State table in the middle of the SIDE Module display, along with a time stamp to indicate when the status was changed.\nPressing the Edit button will allow the user to add custom operational status codes. For example, noise conditions may vary considerably when seismic shooting and not shooting, so it may be sensible to have separate statuses for each of those conditions.\nIt may also be desirable to avoid Random Drill tests during certain ‘Critical Monitoring’ periods such as immediately prior to line start. Random Drill tests can therefore be allowed or disabled for specific operations states by checking or unchecking the appropriate box.\nPrevious: Quick/Random Test Parameters\nNext: Information Tables",

    "text": "The Signal Injection and Detection Evaluator (SIDE) Module offers the ability to predict detection efficacy and document real-time automated detector and human operator effectiveness as a function of distance (range) between a detector and the sound source. Incorporating the SIDE module into PAMGuard will improve the scientific validity of any monitoring and mitigation regimes that use PAM as part of their suite of survey methods. It will serve as a toolkit for performance monitoring on both commercial and non-commercial projects.\nIt is hoped that the integration of the SIDE module into PAMGuard will increase the pace of acceptance of PAM methodologies by regulatory authorities, by allowing an objective evaluation metric for critical assessment of in situ detection performance within specified monitoring distances and proposed PAM programs. In addition, the ability to automatically generate summary evaluation statistics in a standardized format will support and encourage the development and adoption of PAM standards throughout the industry. Importantly, use of SIDE will allow the efficacy and quality of different PAM operations to be objectively evaluated by non-specialists, and to allow operators to test the system themselves.\n\nClusters, Signals, and Sequences\n\nSpecies Clusters\nThere are over 70 species of marine mammals, and it is impossible to define a set of test signals for every one of those species. However, groups of related species often share similar signal properties. This has led to the definition of a set of species clusters for the SIDE module. A species cluster is defined as a group of marine mammal species that share similar acoustic signal characteristics. Each species cluster is associated with a specific default call type that is expected to occur over a particular frequency bandwidth, over a range of source levels (i.e. loudness), and with a particular structure (pulsive, tonal, frequency sweep, etc.) and repetition rate. There are 9 different species clusters in the SIDE modules that the operator can test with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies Cluster Name\nSignal Type and Bounds\nDuration\nSource Level (pk-pk) [dB re 1 ?Pa @ 1m]\nNumber of signals in a sequence\nDepth distribution of injected signals [m]\n\n\n\n\nLow-frequency baleen whales\nRandom linear sweep between 15-100 Hz.

Raised sin window.\n77 (� 7) microseconds (mean ICI = 0.4 s, slowly varying)\n168 � 13\n10 clicks per sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignals\nA signal is defined as a discrete vocalization that has a specific duration, frequency range, amplitude and depth as described in the table above. Using these parameters, individual signals are generated and displayed in PAMGuard spectrograms.\nA synthetic signal detection should not result in an unnecessary mitigation event during application of the SIDE module in a commercial survey. Therefore, the signal generation algorithm uses only key characteristics of the signal necessary to trigger automated detections. The simplified signals are suitable for use with the PAMGuard detectors, which are generally looking for quite a broad range of sound types. Operators should be able to recognize signals from background noise, but not mistake them for actual marine mammal vocalizations. They are not suitable for use with species-specific classifiers (e.g. the Rocca module, or Whistle classifier), which will reject them as unknown or make a random classification.\nSynthetic dolphin whistles are shown in the image below. \n\n\nSequences\nWith the exception of some baleen whales, few cetaceans will make just one call over the course of a minute. In practice, PAM systems often make detection decisions based on an entire call sequence, rather than by individual signals. A sequence is therefore defined as a series of signals that are associated with one another in the call repertoire of the species cluster.\nThe SIDE module generates sequences in a manner relevant to how both automatic detectors and humans make detection decisions. The module randomly varies the number of individual calls in a sequence, however the mean number of signals per sequence for each species cluster remains consistent. As with the individual synthetic sounds, the intent was not to generate a series of sounds that represent the actual vocal output of an animal but to generate enough signal for a detector or alert an operator to determine that an animal is present.\n\n\n\nTests\nA Test is defined as a collection of rapidly injected sequences for each cluster to answer the question Can my system detect calls from a number of species clusters at specified distances, under the current noise conditions? In order to achieve this, a number of sequences of sounds are generated and injected into the current audio stream. The testing algorithm performs the following series of steps:\n\nRandomly generates a time to produce a sequence of signals\nGenerates a range, depth, and bearing of a source. The detection range of interest (generally the radius of the mitigation zone) and randomization factor can be set by the operator in the Species Cluster settings panel\nSelects the number of sequences to generate based on parameters provided by the species cluster (see table above).\nSynthesizes individual signals representative of the bandwidth and temporal structure specified for that particular species cluster (see table above).\nScales the signals according to the expected received level implied by the source slant range, source level distribution, and propagation law.\nInserts the appropriately scaled and time-delayed synthesized sequences into multi-channel real-time (or archived data being streamed in real-time) data streams. Accurate time delays are essential since they allow PAMGuard modules to accurately localize the signals. This is important since operators, and some detectors, often use the regularity of multiple calls being detected on a consistent bearing to confirm a detection.\n\nTwo types of test are available, a Quick Test (QT) and a Random Test (Drill). Both operate in almost exactly the same say and generate similar output, but serve slightly different purposes.\n\nQuick Test\nThe goal of a Quick Test is to determine the detection functionality of the PAM system in the current environmental conditions. The test is not intended to evaluate operator performance, but primarily to evaluate the efficacy of the automated detectors.\nSequences are run one after the other with little or no delay, in order to generate sufficient data for evaluation in the shortest possible amount of time. In the image below, the generated signals of a Quick Test are shown as blue highlighted contours.\n\nDetection matching takes place in real time, with the SIDE module monitoring data coming from each detector and matching the simulated sounds with the detections. Since a precise time of detection is available for automatic detections, a match between an injected signal and detection is counted if there is overlap in time and frequency of the simulated sounds (allowing for appropriate propagation time delays) and the detection.\nQuick Tests can be particularly useful at the start of a PAM operation to determine how well the system is operating under the current noise conditions. This could lead to reconfiguration of the detectors or changes to the hydrophone deployment in order to improve detection efficiency (confirmed by further quick tests) before operations start in earnest. Quick Tests can be repeated whenever conditions change and detector efficacy is in question.\n\n\nRandom Drill\nRandom Drills are intended to test both operator alertness and automated detector efficiency over much longer periods of time and different noise conditions. Sequences are injected into the audio stream like the Quick Test, but at an infrequent rate (every few hours) over a period of days or even weeks.\n\nOver an extended period of time Random Drills will generate the same statistics as the quick tests, but are more likely to capture the full range of operational (noise) conditions and operator attentiveness.\nNext: Configuring the SIDE Module",

If the sensitive bandwidth of a detector does not overlap with the bandwidth of a sound, then the selection box will be disabled. For each cluster the operator can select a primary detector, which will appear first in any reports.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the operator to determine which detectors (besides the primary) should be selected. Some may not be suitable for particular sound types, or not used by the operator. For example, if the operator typically annotates a spectrogram or hits print screen to record a detection but rarely clicks the things I heard button, then only the first two options would be selected. There is no detriment to activating all actions; however, it will require additional analysis on the operators part to assess detection performance by combining all the actions, and selecting irrelevant detectors will generate a very cluttered report.\nThe SIDE module will only report the detection performance based on a single user action.\nPrevious: Information Tables\nNext: Sidebar",

Once you’ve found the document you wish to delete in the PAMGuard document list, simply right click and select Delete Document ….\nPrevious: Tethys / PAMGuard mappings\nNext: Batch Output",

    "text": "Introduction\nIt is important that when the PAMGuard Viewer is connected to a Tethys database, that it can correctly display lists of Tethys documents for that PAMGuard dataset. This help page explains the relationships between PAMGuard datasets and Tethys documents.\nA PAMGuard dataset is likely to consist of a database, and of a folder of binary files. There may also be sound recordings, though these are not required here.\nA Tethys database is likely to contain data from multiple PAMGuard datasets. These will be in the form of Calibration, Deployment, Detection, and Localization documents. Because the database name may change for a PAMGuard dataset, it is not used in the relationships between PAMGaurd and Tethys. Instead, the relationship relies on the Project name and on Instrument Id from the Array Manager. Because a project may have made several deployments using the same instrument, the dates of the Deployment are also used.\nEach document in a Tethys database has a Name (analogous to a file name and will indeed be the name of the temporary file created when the data were exported) and an Id (often referred to as the Document Id for clarity). For Deployment, Detections, and Localizations documents, PAMGuard will always use the same Name and Id. This is not possible for Calibrations, since there may be multiple copies of Calibrations documents (see below).\n\n\nDeployments\nDeployment documents are at the heart of the link between PAMGuard and Tethys. These are identified by the Project Name from the Projects metadata, and the Instrument Id from the Array Manager. When you open a PAMGuard dataset in Viewer mode, PAMGuard will query the Tethys database for all Deployment documents that have the same Project Name and the same Instrument Id and then from that list it will select those deployments which overlap in time with the PAMGuard data. The Instrument Type in the Array Manager is not used in this linkage.\nThis system is robust, since it is impossible to have the same instrument in two places at the same time. However it does require care on the part of the user to be consistent and careful in setting the Project Name and Instrument Id in PAMGuard.\nFor a static mooring, whether recording continuously or on a duty cycle, there will be one Deployment document for each PAMGuard dataset.\nFor vessel based surveys, where data collection periods may have been more ad-hoc (for instance only during the day time or periods of good weather), there may be multiple Deployment documents, one for each recording period.\n\n\nDetections and Localizations\nEvery Detections and Localizations document has a cross reference to a Deployment document. Therefore, to find these documents, PAMGuard first searches the database for matching Deployment documents, then for every Deployment document matched to the dataset, it runs additional queries to search for Detections and Localisations that match each Deployment.\n\n\nCalibrations\nCalibrations documents should be created for every hydrophone or microphone within the “Instrument” used for a deployment. Because a device may be reused on many Deployments or even across multiple Projects, and it may or may not have been calibrated for each one (or perhaps calibrated twice for each Deployment - before and after), the relationship between Calibrations, Deployments, and a PAMGuard dataset can be more complex.\nPAMGuard creates a name for each calibration document consisting of the Instrument Name and the Instrument Id from the Array Manager and the channel number. Spaces in names are replaced with underscore characters. e.g. if a Instrument Name was “SoundTrap HF600” and the Instrument Id was “64232”, and the channel number 0, then the calibration document Id would be\n    SoundTrap_HF600_64232_ch00\n    ```\n\nHowever, since there may be multiple calibration documents for the same device, the document name would also contain todays date, and would be something like\n\nSoundTrap_HF600_64232_250112_ch0\n```\nfor a document created on 12 January, 2025.\nWhen querying the Tethys database for matching Calibrations documents, PAMGuard first reads ALL Calibrations documents from the database, then selects all of those which have an Id starting with the combined Instrument Name and Instrument Id (in this case SoundTrap_HF600_64232). This selection will not use the document date, since the date of the calibration may not lie within the time period of the Deployment. It is therefore possible that you will see multiple copies of similar calibration documents when you link PAMGuard to a Tethys database. This is fine, the only requirement being that there is at least one calibration document for each hydrophone before PAMGuard will allow you to export Deployments or Calibrations.\nPrevious: Species Codes\nNext: Deleting Documents",

The database is intended to house the metadata from marine mammal detection and localization studies, allowing the user to perform meta analyses or to aggregate data from many experimental efforts based on a common attribute. This resulting database can then be queried based on time, space, or any desired attribute and the results can be integrated with external datasets such as NASA’s Ocean Color, lunar illumination, etc. in a consistent manner. While Tethys is designed primarily for acoustic metadata from marine mammals, the design is general enough to permit use in other areas as well.\nThe Tethys database is not a replacement for the existing PAMGuard Database. Where the PAMGuard database only contains data from a single instrument or cruise, the Tethys database contains data from many cruises and projects and can be used to hold a summary of all data from a lab or organisation. PAMGuard’s Tethys module provides an interface for exporting detailed or summary information about acoustic detections to the Tethys database.\nBefore using the module in PAMGuard, you should install the Tethys Server. While clients that communicate with Tethys can run on a variety of computer operating systems, there are a small number of dependencies on Microsoft technologies that require the server to be installed on a Microsoft Windows machine. Instructions for installing the Tethys Server can be found here.\nModule help:\n\nThe Tethys module (start here)\nThe Connecting to Tethys\nThe Instrument calibrations\nThe Instrument deployments\nThe Detections & Localizations\nGuide to specifying species names",

    "text": "Species Names\nTethys uses the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) to encode species names as taxonomic serial numbers (TSNs), unique numeric identifiers for species. These data conform with several international coding systems which are described on the ITIS standards page.\nIt is not uncommon to be unable to describe a call to the genus level. In such cases, one can use a higher taxonomic level. For example, beaked whale echolocation clicks are distinctive from the clicks of other toothed whales as their pulses have a frequency-modulated component. While they can frequently be associated with the family Hyperodontidae, it is not always possible to associate a click to a specific species as many of the at least twenty-two species remain understudied. In such a case, we would use the TSN for Hyperodontidae, 770799. While not currently supported by PAMGuard, each species identifier has an optional Group attribute that can be used in an ad-hoc manner to provide additional information. This can be used to add population markers, tentative genus groups, etc.\nITIS does not describe abiotic sounds, Tethys records such sounds as follows:\n\nFor anthropogenic signals, the Tethys convention is to use Homo sapiens, TSN 180092, for the species code and describe the human-generated signal via a call type, e.g. ship, mid-frequency active sonar, etc.\nTethys reserves the TSN -10 for geophonic signals. The call type is used to describe the source. Examples include ambient sound, earthquake, rain, etc. Note that negative TSNs are not part of the ITIS standard.\n\nNote that in general, you do not have to worry about remembering TSNs. Tethys uses TSNs internally, but will translate TSNs to/from Latin names or user-defined abbreviations both when querying and presenting results.",

While species names are standardized in Tethys, call names do not have a well-defined standard and experts frequently use different names for the same type of call. Consequently, Tethys does not provide a standard coding for call types and users are free to choose the call type names with which they feel most comfortable.\nThat said, the authors of Tethys do however provide a list of recommend call types for many species. These recommendations can be accessed in the supplemental information of the open access article “Management of acoustic metadata for bioacoustics,” Roch et al. (2016), (DOI:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.12.002).\nWithin PAMGuard, different detectors have different numbers of call types. Some, such as the Whistle and Moan detector, have only one fixed call type “Tonal”, for others such as the Click Detector, the user can define any number of different call types in the click classification configuration. The Tethys interface allows the user to map the internal call types from PAMGuard to ITIS species codes and call types.",

However, the identity of species BWC is unclear, though believed to be some type of beaked whale, so it has been given the code 770799 for Hyperoodontidae.\nAn ITIS code and call/sound type can be associated with each event.

There are however a few small differences and old Logger UDF_ tables may not be fully compatible with PAMGuard.\nThe UDF_ tables define the contents of the individual forms which will appear in PAMGuard and the content of the output database table.\nUDF tables all have the same fixed column format. The Logger forms module will read the contents of each UDF table when it starts up. For each UDF_ table, a new form will be created on the PAMGuard display. For each row in the UDF table a control (something you type into) will be generated on that form. A new database table to receive data from the form will also be created in the databsae and for each control on the form, a column will be created in the output database table.\nFor example, the table UDF_Effort will create a form called effort and an output table in the database also called “Effort”, A row in the UDF_effort table with it’s “Type” set to TIMESTAMP will generate a control on the form for entering dates and times and a column in the Effort table formatted to hold data/time data.\nHere is an simple UDF_ table as an example.\nForms can be modified by editing the UDF tables with database software, or purely from menu driven commands with PAMGuard.",
