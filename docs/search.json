    "text": "The PAMGuard Whistle Classifier described in Gillespie et. al., 2013 examines the contour shapes of whistle detections from the PAMGuard Whistle and Moan Detector and classifies them to species.\nBecause individual whistles generally don’t contain sufficient information for accurate classification, the classifier generates statistics over multiple whistle detections before reporting.\nUsers can train the classifier with recordings of their own, which is recommended, since many species are known to have regional variation in their repertoire. Since this is not always possible, below we provide links to pre-trained classifiers which can be imported into PAMGuard.\nIf you have a trained whistle classifier for PAMGuard which you would like to share, please get in touch at info@pamguard.org."

    "text": "Classifier models from Gillespie et. al., 2013\nThese four models are the ones described in our 2013 paper describing the classifier. The classifiers have been rebuilt to be compatible with the latest version of PAMGuard, but use the same training data as was used for the 2013 paper. Note that values in the confusion matrices will differ slightly from the 2013 versions due to different random data selections in the training process. However, since the final build of each classifier uses all training data, the actual classifier models are identical to the previously published versions.\nWhen training these classifiers, species recordings were collected from a number of locations, including the Azores, Gulf of Mexico, and the Mediterranean Sea. When making species groups for each geographic region, all available recordings of species from that region were used, assuming no regional differences between locations - something we now know to be incorrect.

    "text": "Introduction to static monitoring in PAMGuard\n\nIntroduction\nThis tutorial is a step by step guide for using PAMGuard to process long term recordings from a static autonomous recorder. The tutorial uses example data from a SoundTrap device deployed off the Scottish West Coast with plenty of dolphin and porpoise encounters.\n\n\nSpecies\n\nDolphins (multiple species)\nNBHF (harbour porpoises)\nHumpback whales\nSonar\n\n\n\nWhat you will learn\nUsers will be guided step by step in how to create a workflow in PAMGuard which processes medium frequency data to find whistles from dolphins and lower frequency data to detect baleen whale calls and man made sounds such military sonar. Some basic soundscape metrics such as a third octave noise measurements and long term spectral averages are explored. The SoundTrap device that was used to record also runs an on-board click detector at high frequencies to detect porpoise and dolphin echolocation clicks. The tutorial demonstrates how to import these data into PAMGuard.\nOnce users have set up their workflow the dataset contains a subset of sound files to process as an example. The dataset also contains the entire processed dataset so users can open PAMGuard viewer mode and view weeks of data as if they had processed the entire dataset. The tutorial demonstrates how to navigate through and visualise processed data, run additional species classifiers and export data to MATLAB, R and wav files.\nBy the end of the tutorial uses will be familiar with the basic capabilities of PAMGuard and how to construct an acoustic workflow and use the processed data. This provides a foundation for using more complex automated analysis methods such as deep learning classifications, click train detector and localisation methods.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial is suitable for beginners with PAMGuard.\n\n\nDownloads\nThe tutorial text is in Introduction to Sound Traps.pdf. You will also need to download the accompanying dataset from Zenodo \nRisch, D., Quer, S., Edwards, E., Beck, S., Macaulay, J., Calderan, S. (2018).

    "text": "Exercise 3: Load a Folder of Click Files and Count the Classified Clicks\nSo far, we have opened one of the twelve click files. In reality we want to deal with any number of files in a folder. In this exercise, we will read all twelve binary files at once and count the number of classified clicks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassified click definition\n\n\n\nclicks[0] is considered a classified click when clicks[0].type == 1.\n\n\n\nMethod 1: loading files individually into memory (recommended)\n\nMATLABRPython\n\n\nFirst, create an array of the files within your desired folder. The folder that you should load is the same of that which contained the click file in exercise 1. When we use the fullfile() method we pass in a file name mask *.pgdf to filter the files to only those with a .pgdf extension.\nfolderName = '\\enter\\your\\path\\porpoise_data\\PAMBinary\\20130710\\';\nbinaryFiles = dir(fullfile(folderName, '*.pgdf'));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe variable binaryFiles is an array of MATLAB structures, each of which contains information about a file in the folder. This allows us to open up the files one-at-a-time to prevent excessive memory usage.\n\n\nNow we must create a for loop to go through each of the files in binaryFiles, and load them in using loadPamguardBinaryFile() (as in exercises 1 and 2).\nfor i = 1:length(binaryFiles)\n    filePath = fullfile(folderName, binaryFiles(i).name);\n    clicks = pgmatlab.loadPamguardBinaryFile(filePath);\nend\nThis code achieves very little. Each time we load one of the files, it is almost immediately dumped from memory as the loop enters its next iteration - no useful information is produced.\nNow we will use a nested loop to count the number of porpoise clicks there exist in all twelve data files in the folder. We use a technique called nested looping here to increment a global counter. The outer loop (where i is incremented) goes through all the files, and the inner loop (where j is incremented) goes through all the clicks in each file to check whether they are classified or not.\ncount = 0;\nfor i = 1:length(binaryFiles)\n    filePath = fullfile(folderName, binaryFiles(i).name);\n    clicks = pgmatlab.loadPamguardBinaryFile(filePath);\n    for j = 1:length(clicks)\n        if (clicks(j).type == 1)\n            count = count + 1;\n        end\n    end\n    fprintf('Porpoise click count after %d files is %d\\n', i, count);\nend\n\n\nFirst, create an array of the files within your desired folder. The folder that you should load is the same of that which contained the click file in exercise 1. We use the in-built method list.files() with a pattern \\\\.pgdf$ to mask the files.\nfolderName = '\\enter\\your\\path\\porpoise_data\\PAMBinary\\20130710\\';\nfileNames &lt;- list.files(folderName, pattern = \"\\\\.pgdf$\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe variable fileNames is an array of file names (as strings). This allows us to open up the files one-at-a-time to prevent excessive memory usage. Note that you can use\nfor (val in fnames) {\n  print(val)\n}\nto print all the file names\n\n\nNow we must create a for-loop to go through each of the files represented by file names in fileNames, and load them in using loadPamguardBinaryFile() (as in exercises 1 and 2).\nfor (filename in fnames) {\n    # load each click file.\n    clicks &lt;- loadPamguardBinaryFile(file.path(folder, filename));  \n}\nThis code achieves very little. Each time we load one of the files, it is almost immediately dumped from memory as the loop enters its next iteration - no useful information is produced.\nNow we will use a nested loop to count the number of porpoise clicks there exist in all twelve data files in the folder. We use a technique called nested looping here to increment a global counter. The outer loop goes through all the files, and the inner loop goes through all the clicks in each file to check whether they are classified or not.\ncount = 0;\nfor (filename in fnames) {\n  # load each click file.\n  clicks &lt;- loadPamguardBinaryFile(file.path(folder, filename));\n  # iterate through the click files to count the classified clicks.\n  for (click in clicks$data) {\n    if (click$type == 1) {\n      count = count + 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nFirst, create an array of the files within your desired folder. The folder that you should load is the same of that which contained the click file in exercise 1. We use the native Python library pathlib to list all files within a folder (using the Path class), and mark them using the mask *.pgdf.\nimport pathlib, pypamguard\nfolder_name = '\\enter\\your\\path\\porpoise_data\\PAMBinary\\20130710\\'\nfile_names = pathlib.Path(folder_name).glob('*.pgdf')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe variable file_names is an array of file names (as strings). This allows us to open up the files one-at-a-time to prevent excessive memory usage.\n\n\nNow we must create a for-loop to go through each of the files in file_names, and load them in using load_pamguard_binary_file() (as in exercises 1 and 2).\n# code to create file_names variable goes here\nfor file_name in file_names:\n    clicks = pypamguard.load_pamguard_binary_file(pathlib.Path(file_name))\nThis code achieves very little. Each time we load one of the files, it is almost immediately dumped from memory as the loop enters its next iteration - no useful information is produced.\nNow we will use a nested loop to count the number of porpoise clicks there exist in all twelve data files in the folder. We use a technique called nested looping here to increment a global counter. The outer loop goes through all the files, and the inner loop goes through all the clicks in each file to check whether they are classified or not.\n# code to create file_names variable goes here\ncount = 0;\nfor file_name in file_names:\n    clicks = pypamguard.load_pamguard_binary_file(pathlib.Path(file_name))\n    for click in clicks.data:\n        if click.type == 1:\n            count += 1;\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2: loading all data into memory at once (memory intensive)\nEach library has a function you can use to load all the files in a folder into memory at once. This can offer simplicity with respect to the nested loops you wrote above as you would no longer be responsible for looping through the individual files in the folder you wish to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse at own risk\n\n\n\nThe method to load all files in the folder into memory at once places a heavy burden on your computer’s memory. Only use this function if you are processing a small number of files, or are pre-filtering them significantly (we do not cover that in this tutorial).\n\n\n\nMATLABRPython\n\n\nfolderName = '/enter/your/path/porpoise_data/PAMBinary/20130710';\nclicksAll = pgmatlab.loadPamguardBinaryFolder(folderName, \"Click_Detector_Click_Detector_Clicks_*.pgdf\");\ncount = 0;\nfor i = 1:length(clicksAll)\n    if (clicksAll(i).type == 1)\n        count = count + 1;\n    end\nend\n\n\nR has no function to load all files in a folder at once. You should use for loops as described above.\n\n\nimport pypamguard\nfolder_name = '/enter/your/path/porpoise_data/Binary/20130710'\nclicks_all = pypamguard.load_pamguard_binary_folder(folder_name)\ncount = 0\nfor click in clicks_all.data:\n    if click.type == 1:\n        count += 1"

    "section": "What you will learn",
    "text": "What you will learn\n\nSection 1 - Right whales\nIn section 1, you will be shown how to process raw low frequency sound files to detect North Atlantic Right whale upsweeps using a deep learning model developed by Shiu et al, (2020). This model was trained on a widely available dataset used to test automated classifiers for right whales and was a significant improvement on previous methods. The end of the tutorial compares the deep learning model against a more heuristic Right whale classifier built into PAMGuard. Users will also learn how to export deep learning detections to MATLAB, R and wav files.\n\n\nSection 2 - Bats\nSection 2 deals with much higher frequency sound files (384kHz) recorded by an AudioMoth near woodland in Denmark. The sound files contain a large number of bat calls from different species, primarily Myotis daubentonii and Pipistrellus pygmaeus An AnimalSpot model from Brinkløv et al, (2023) has been supplied which classifies bat calls based on a segment of sound data around one thousand samples in length. However, it takes around 10-100ms to run a single segment through the classification algorithm and there are at least 384 non-overlapping chunks in one second of data. Some basic maths and that shows that this classifier will run well below real time. To address this, users will use PAMGuard to run a very simple bat detector and then run the deep learning model on the detected data rather than all the raw data.\n\n\nSection 3 - Gibbons\nIn section 3 you will learn how to integrate the deep learning into a workflows in PAMGuard. We use some example of Gibbon calls detected by a 4 channel recorder in Laos. The 4 channel recorder can be determine a bearing to call - the output of the deep learning module is connected with the bearing module so that any classified call is localized. Although not part of the tutorial, the end goal of this project was to use the bearings to monitor the abundance of gibbons in the forest."

This is then followed by a rather silly classifier that generates some random numbers, modifies them a bit based on where the data are being collected, and a few other things, then makes a random classification to one of two (also entirely fictional) sub-species.\nAll of this has been done in order to use as many PAMGuard features as possible, including graphics overlays, data filters, symbol managers, a Tethys output module, etc.\nWe hope that you don’t waste too much time actually searching for Haggis in the Scottish Highlands (though we do recommend visiting the area to enjoy the wonderful scenery).\nWe hope that you do find this example code useful, particularly if you’re setting out on the journey of building your own PAMGuard module.\n\nDownloads\nSource Code\nBuilt Module\nExample Configuration"

    "text": "PAMGuard 2.02.17 is now available\n2.02.15 - 16 were big releases with a lot of new features (AI, Tethys, exporter, Mac version, etc.). However, the inevitable trade-off with adding more stuff to PAMGuard is that we introduce or neglect bugs. 2.02.17 deals with some major bugs in post-processing of acoustic data and spectrograms in viewer mode. SUD files, in particular, were causing issues, and there was a bug in viewer mode that made offline spectrograms slow and often wrong. Now that field season is underway, we are using PAMGuard for our own data analysis which is why we caught some of these bugs; the rest were because folk emailed us or added an issue on GitHub - if you find a bug, please do let us know so we can fix it!\nIt wasn’t all just fixes though - there are some really nice new features too, including the ability for the noise band monitor (both FFT and Filter Bank modules) to use decidecade and decade bands, implementing the export of noise data to R and MATLAB directly from PAMGuard and adding the ability to read duty cycle data from .x.wav files, making PAMGuard more useful for our colleagues over the other side of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe know it’s frustrating if PAMGuard does not work, and (subject to funding) we are taking steps to make releases more stable by developing a new test framework. It’s going to take time, and we won’t catch every bug, but it should mean that in the coming few years PAMGuard is generally more resilient to bugs, making life easier for developers and users!\n\n\nHere’s a full list of what was done and you can always check out GitHub Issues page to see what specifically was fixed.\n\nNew Features\nImproved Error Trapping and Reporting. Added features to the PAMGuard core data handling to trap any errors in each module and better log them in the PAMGuard log files. When PAMGuard starts, it will automatically analyse the log file from the previous run for errors. If errors are found, then the user will be prompted to send a report to the PAMGuard team via email. See help on log files for further details.\nIssue 211. Noise Band Measurement module (the one that uses filter banks). Added features to support other types of frequency band as well as standard octave and third octave. PAMGuard now supports Octave, Third Octave, Deci-decade, Decade, 1/10 Octave, and 1/12 Octave bands.\nIssue 211. Noise Monitor Module (the one that used FFT data). Added 1/10 decade, Octave, and Decade bands options. Improved data selection handling.\nIssue 215. x.wav Files. Support for duty cycling with .x.wav files from SCRIPPS HARP recorders.\nExport function for noise band data to Matlab, R, etc.\n\n\nBug Fixes\nIssue 207. Marked clicks in click detector not rematching when data reloaded. This was occurring when multiple clicks had the same millisecond time and has now been rectified.\nTethys deployments table. Deployments table in Tethys was showing multiple lines for duty cycled data. Duty cycled data will now display as a single row of data in the Deployments table on the display.\nIssue 210. SUD Files. Fixed several issues: support for multi channel files; handling corrupt files; reloading audio data for spectrogram displays in viewer.\nIssue 230. Updated SUD reader to handle latest soundtrap firmware that supports accelerometers and magnetometers.\nIssue 220. Fixed spectrogram scrolling issues in Spectrogram and FX Time display.\nIssue 216. GEBCO Raster map files not loading. Issue now fixed.\nIssue 232. Files without dates. Will now correctly process a folder of files without dates. However, you are strongly recommended to have valid dates in your file names."

The amount of data generated by PAM studies calls for robust automatic classifiers. Deep learning (DL) techniques have been proven effective in identifying acoustic signals in challenging datasets, but due to their black-box nature their underlying biases are hard to quantify. This study compares human analyst annotations, a multi-hypothesis tracking (MHT) click train classifier and a DL-based acoustic classifier to classify acoustic recordings based on the presence or absence of sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) click trains and study the temporal and spatial distributions of the Mediterranean sperm whale subpopulation around the Balearic Islands. The MHT and DL classifiers showed agreements with human labels of 85.7% and 85.0%, respectively, on data from sites they were trained on, but both saw a drop in performance when deployed on a new site. Agreement rates between classifiers surpassed those between human experts. Modeled seasonal and diel variations in sperm whale detections for both classifiers showed compatible results, revealing an increase in occurrence and diurnal activity during the summer and autumn months. This study highlights the strengths and limitations of two automatic classification algorithms to extract biologically useful information from large acoustic datasets.

    "section": "Writing PAMGuard Plug-ins",
    "text": "Writing PAMGuard Plug-ins\nARCHIVING PLUG-INS INTO A JAR FILE FOR DISTRIBUTION\nEven if the plugin is intended as an External module, it is easiest to develop it as a Core module. In other words, create a new package in the PAMGuard code base to hold all of the new classes, and add a reference to the package classes in PamModel. This way, dependencies do not need to be explicitly managed and debugging is simplified. All development should be done within the new package, and the core PAMGuard classes should not be changed (if modifications are necessary, please contact the PAMGuard development team first).\nTo make an external PAMGuard plug-in available to PAMGuard users once development is complete, it is necessary to archive the class files and support files (including help files, graphics, sound files, etc.) into a java archive (jar) file.\nPrior to archiving, the developer must add a class to the project package which implements one of two interfaces: PamModel.PamPluginInterface (for standard plug-in modules) or Acquisition.DaqSystemInterface (for data acquisition modules such as sound cards, file streams, etc.). Override all of the Interface’s inherited methods, returning appropriate values as specified in the Javadoc comments. Create a String object to hold the jar file name. This parameter does not need to be initialized to anything specific; the value will be set by PAMGuard via the inherited setter method. The code could be as simple as\nString jarFile; \n@Override public void setJarFile(String jarFile) { \n  this.jarFile = jarFile; \n} \nIt is strongly recommended that help files be included with the plug-in. PAMGuard uses Oracle’s JavaHelp 2.0 system (complete details can be found here). Each page in the help file is an HTML document. Create individual HTML pages (with links and images) to describe the setup and operation of the plug-in, and save all files in the same package folder that your java program is in. Once the pages are completed, create the helpset and support files (map, TOC, index, etc.). Programs like jhelpdev can greatly simplify the process of creating these files.\n\nNotes:\nTo have the help files added to an existing category (i.e. Classifiers, Detectors, etc.) in the PAMGUARDhelp table of contents, the top-level tag text attribute in the plug-in’s TOC xml file must match the category name exactly. Some category names have a space character at the end. If in doubt, check the PAMGUARDTOC.xml file found in src/help for a list of the TOC entries. If the top-level tag text attribute in the plug-in’s TOC xml file does not match any of the category names in the table of contents, the item is simply appended to the bottom of the list. To match the existing table of contents look-and-feel, each tag in the plug-in’s TOC xml file should have image=”topic” added as an attribute. Copy the image.gif file found in src/help to the plug-in package folder. Ensure the line is in the plug-in’s map.jhm file\nSpecify the name of the helpset file in the plug-in interface class. Look through the interface Javadoc documentation for the correct format to use.\nFollow these steps to bundle all files together into a single jar, ready for distribution. Note the following are specific to the Eclipse IDE. Other IDE’s will have similar functionality:\nRight-click on the project name in the Package Explorer view and select Export In the Export window, click on the Java folder and highlight JAR file. Hit Next In the window frame on the left, make sure the package and all necessary subfolders are selected to export (sometimes subfolders created by JavaHelp - such as JavaHelpSearch – are not included in the export list by default). Click on the box beside “Export generated class files and resources” and “Export Java source files and resources”. Enter the name of the exported jar file in the text box under “Select the export destination”. You can click on the box beside “Compress the contents of the JAR file”, though this is optional. The default values for the remainder of the windows can be used. Hit Finish to export the package to the location specified.\nTo test the jar file, move it to the plugins subfolder in the PAMGuard installation folder. If there is no plugins folder, create one. When PAMGuard is started, it should find the jar file and use the information in the interface class to dynamically load the code. Remember to rename/delete the package in the PAMGuard code first, to ensure that you are really testing the jar file contents and not the original code.\nFinal note: if plug-in development has been done in the core PAMGuard code and then exported to a jar, the *.class files may still exist in the PAMGuard project’s bin subfolder (even if the original package has been deleted). If testing the plug-in jar in the IDE, first look through the bin subfolder and delete any plug-in* .class files that are stored. If PAMGuard finds the classes in both the bin folder and the jar file, it is unclear which would get loaded at runtime. The class files are replaced in the bin folder every time a build is completed. Also, remember to remove references to the new module from the PamModel class, as this will be taken care of by the jar file."

    "text": "Model\nNortheast Atlantic delphinID click and whistle classifiers can be found on Zenodo.\ndelphinID does not use raw audio data as its input for classification; instead, it processes detected PAMGuard whistle contours and click detections. The first step is therefore to run the WMD and the Click Detector on wav files in PAMGuard. The output is then run through the delphinID modelsloaded into the Deep Learning module in PAMGuard. The resulting click and whistle predictions can then be combined for final species classification via an R application (see README file) also accessible through the Zenodo download. Also included in the download are a PAMGuard settings file (.psfx) for delphinID and a README file containing documentation, tutorials, and extra information. \nTo run delphinID, users must set the location of the database, binary store and sound files, and open both of PAMGuard’s deep learning modules. To do this go to Settings -&gt; Raw Deep Learning Classifier_Clicks and select the deep learning models on their local machine. The configuration will then detect whistle contours and clicks from raw sound data, pass the detections to both deep learning modules and save the results in the PAMGuard database. Also note that delphinID can run in viewer mode if whistles and/or click detections are part of the data model."

    "text": "Marine mammals come in many shapes and sizes. This applies to their vocalisations as much as their bodys, so different detectors are needed for different calls from different species.\nThe types of studies we undertake also vary enormously, so the software configuration you might use to process data from a single autonomous recorder might be very different from the configuration you need on a ship based survey, with a complex hydrophone array of many channels. On a ship, you’ll probably also use PAMGuard to collect navigation data from the ships GPS and other sensors.\nFor some studies, you may also want to use more than one instance of the same module. For example, you may want to generate spectrograms on high frequency and low frequency data at the same time using the FFT (Spectrogram) Engine module, or you might want to run a high frequency and a low frequency click detector, each looking for clicks at different frequencies.\nPAMGuard therefore uses a modular architecture, where you the user load the modules you want to use. For some tasks, this may only be one or two, for others many dozens. You’re in charge. However, before you make a configuration with dozens of modules for dozens of species, get used to the system with one or two detectors.\nModules are organised by groups, which correspond to menu groups for adding modules in PAMGuard. For each module, we give the name, the maximum (or in some cases minimum number that can be used and a brief description. For further information, launch PAMGuard and read the online help.\nCurrently, PAMGuard contains 70 different modules.\nIf you’re new to PAMGuard, start at the Tutorials page which will help you get going.\nMaps and Mapping, Utilities, Sensors, Displays, Sound Processing, Detectors, Classifiers, Localisers, Visual Methods"

    "text": "PAMGuard in the field\nPAMGuard, running on a standard consumer laptop PC, processed four-channels of data from a towed hydrophone array deployed of the stern of the vessel. Researchers onboard the ships could monitor the incoming sounds for various cetacean species. Monitoring data in real-time with PAMGuard meant some species such as sperm whales could be tracked acoustically during their foraging dives, or by listening out for codas produced at the surface, helping teams onboard find the sperm whales at the surface and take ID photos. Sharing these ID photos with local researchers helps to gain further insights into animal movements (Thompson et al., 2024). All the incoming acoustic data was recorded using PAMGuard so that the data could be reanalysed onshore for cetacean presence.\n\n\n\nDr. Kirsten Young deploying the towed hydrophone array from the stern of the MY Arctic Sunrise. Credit: Greenpeace International / D. Zalcman\n\n\nWith over 25 TB of acoustic data collected during the first pole to pole survey, researchers developed a streamlined workflow using PAMGuard to efficiently process large quantities of data collected with a towed hydrophone array (Webber et al., 2022). Since then, this workflow, with some tweaking here and there, has been applied to all the acoustic surveys conducted onboard Greenpeace ships.\nAcoustic recordings which could be linked to visually verified single species sighting have been made available online to aid in the development of automated classification algorithms. For example, a Risso’s dolphin click classifier. Resulting data on cetacean occurrence and diversity from these surveys, have been and will continue to be published (e.g.  Thompson et al., 2023, Webber et al., 2023, Webber et al., 2025, Young et al., 2025), increasing the pool of knowledge which can be drawn upon to implement conservation measures, or push for further systematic survey effort in poorly studied regions.\n\n\n\nAcoustic monitoring station running PAMGuard, set up on the SY Rainbow Warrior.\n\n\nGreenpeace is now also trialing the use of drifting vertical hydrophone arrays to better detect more cryptic species such as beaked whales. Beaked whale are known to be particularly sensitive to disturbance from anthropogenic activities. PAMGuard is currently being used to process the data from these drifters while they are being tested.\nThe ability of PAMGuard to collect and process data in real-time, and it’s efficient post-processing has been crucial to aid researchers during these surveys, facilitating more complete cetacean diversity assessments to be conducted.\n\n\n\nThe MY Arctic Sunrise towing the hydrophone array in Antarctic waters.

    "section": "Vision",
    "text": "Vision\nThe PAMGuard project started in 2006, intending to address the fundamental limitations of existing cetacean passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) software by creating an integrated software infrastructure that is open source and available to all PAM users for the benefit of the marine environment.\nThe PAMGuard software provides a suite of Detection, Classification, and Localization algorithms developed specifically for the many types of sounds made by different species. The algorithms are backed up by a powerful user interface that allows a human operator to view sounds in real time, confirm the output of the automatic detectors, and mark out sounds manually when automatic detection is not possible."

    "section": "Writing PAMGuard Plug-ins",
    "text": "Writing PAMGuard Plug-ins\n\nAdding plug-ins to the Core PAMGuard model\nTo make a PAMGuard plug-in available to PAMGuard users it is necessary to edit the java file PamModel/PamModel.java.\nFirst you register the module with PAMGuard using\nPamModuleInfo myModule = PamModuleInfo.registerControlledUnit (String className, String description);\nwhere className is the class name of the class PamControlledUnit and description is the descriptive name of the module.\nFor example\nPamModuleInfo myModule = PamModuleInfo.registerControlledUnit (\"GPS.GPSControl\", \"GPS Processing\");\nadds the GPS module.\nThe module will now be listed in the PAMGuard File/Add Modules menu from where the user can create instances of the module.\nThe PAMGuard settings manager will be aware of the new module and will automatically create the module the next time PAMGuard is run. ### Add the module to a menu group\nDue to the large number of PAMGuard modules now in existence, you will want to have your module listed in one of the sub menus of the File/Add Modules menu. You can add your module to one of the existing groups or you can create a new group of your own. For example, the following code adds the GPS module to the Map menu group\nmyModule.setModulesMenuGroup(mapsGroup);\n\n\nSet module data dependencies\nIt is likely that your module will be dependent on data from some other PAMGuard module. For example, the click detector requires raw data from an acquisition module, the whistle detector required raw data from a FFT module and the GPS module requires data from an NMEA data source.\nYou can set module dependencies using\nPamModuleInfo.addDependency(PamDependency dependency)\nfor example\nmyModule.addDependency(new PamDependency(NMEADataUnit.class, \"NMEA.NMEAControl\")); \ntells PAMGuard that myModule is dependent on some source of NMEADataUnit and that a possible source of this type of data is the NMEA.NMEAControl module.\nNote that some types of data may be produced by many different modules, so here you should specify the most common source of the data your module will use.\n\n\nSetting the minimum and maximum numbers of module instances\nYou can use two functions\nPamModuleInfo.setMinNumber(int minNumber)\nPamModuleInfo.setMaxNumber(int maxNumber)\nto set the minimum and maximum numbers of a given module type.\nIf these are not set (which is generally the case), then the minimum number defaults to zero and there is no maximum number.\nIf you set a minimum number, then PAMGuard will automatically create that number of modules at start up.\nIf you set a maximum number then PAMGuard will prevent you from creating more than that number of modules."

This meant that, although we did not save the raw high-frequency files, we had sound files for the most complex part of the soundscape (the lower frequencies) and detected high frequency transient sounds at a high false-positive rate, along with soundscape metrics for the higher frequencies. In this way, we were able to retain the interesting parts of the data but reduce our dataset to about one-tenth of what it would have been if we had saved the raw data.\n\n\n\nA diagram of the acoustic workflow used in the project.

Researchers get access to cutting edge classifiers and authors get more exposure, citations and in general make a greater impact after their hard work - win win!\nIf you want to make your model available there are a few things you will need to do.\n\nFirstly, you will need a deep learning model that works in PAMGuard - see here for more information on how to do that.\nCreate a settings file (**.psfx file) which shows an example of the deep learning model running with an example sound file which must be available to share.\nCreate a Markdown document which provides an overview of your model. Use the Shiu/Palmer Right whale model as a template. Note this must include a link to a publication which describes your model in detail.\nArchive the model, settings file and example sound file in a public repository such as Zenodo so that it has a DOI.\n\nOnce that is all done, send us through everything - we will check it over and, if all OK, publish on the website."

It wouldn’t be appropriate to include this in the PAMGuard core, but it’s useful to us on one particular project.\nThe PAMGuard framework allows for easy development of additional types of sub-module plugin as required. These must all be based around a sub-class of CommonPluginInterface. Any plugin module found in the PAMGuard plugins folder will be loaded when PAMGuard starts and it’s help files added to the PAMGuard online help. If it’s a new sub-plugin type, you’ll also have to add code to the module using the plugin in oder to use that plugin. Examples modules that use sub-module plugins are AnalolgDeviceManager and AcquisitionControl for examples.\nAn example analog sensor plugin is here and a sound acquisition plugin here."

Tasks can broadly be split into maintenance tasks and new functionality.\n\nMaintenance Tasks\nWithout code maintenance, there is a risk that PAMGuard will become unstable or inefficient on new computer hardware and new versions of operating systems. Mac have already switched to ARM processors, and Windows are heading in the same direction. Generally, this is a good thing since these processors are more powerful, and many are now optimised for running deep learning (AI) models. However, it’s also the case that to get the most out of these processors, we’re going to have to rebuild parts of PAMGuard and make different installers. All of this takes time and resource.\nWe aim to:\n\nContinue user support\nImprove pre-release testing\nUpdate user tutorials\nBuild new Installers for Windows ARM Processors\nProvide better support for Mac computers, including real time processing\nFurther update this website\n\n\n\nNew Functionality\nThe marine mammal acoustics community have become increasingly active during the lifetime of PAMGuard, particularly through the DCLDE workshops which are generally held every two years. Several of the new algorithms that have been presented at these workshops would be suitable for implementation into PAMGuard. However, taking Matlab or Python code that was written to process files offline can require a lot of work to get it running in real time.\nIn particular, we want to:\n\nContinue to integrate Machine Learning algorithms / AI throughout PAMGuard.\nImplement newly developed methods for whistle extraction into PAMGuards real time framework.\nDevelop and implement better click train detection / tracking algorithms."

    "text": "Another paper using PAMGuard. For this one, we took a break from Passive Acoustics and developed a plugin module which can process data from Tritech multibeam sonars to track seals around a tidal turbine.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14844\nSeals exhibit localised avoidance of operational tidal turbines\nJessica Montabaranom, Douglas Gillespie, Emma Longden, Katie Rapson, Anhelina Holoborodko, Carol Sparling, Gordon Hastie\nABSTRACT\n\nTidally energetic habitats are used by a range of marine mammals, including pinnipeds. These areas are also important to the tidal energy industry, leading to an overlap between tidal developments and important habitats used by seals. The concerns around negative ecological impacts from tidal turbines derive primarily from the potential for fatal collisions between animals and the moving parts of the turbine (i.e. blades) and habitat exclusion from important areas.\nWe quantified the number of encounters of seals within close range (10s of metres) of the turbine and estimated the likelihood of seal presence over an annual cycle. Data were collected with two multibeam sonars monitoring an operational turbine in the Pentland Firth, Scotland, between May 2022 and June 2023. There were 704 seal encounters within close range of the turbine.\nWe used generalised additive models (GAMs) to investigate the temporal patterns of seal presence at the turbine site. Results showed that the probability of seal presence was significantly higher at slack water, at night and during the winter months (November–January: mean of ~4 seals a day). When comparing seal presence between periods of turbine operation and non-operation, the model predicted a decrease in presence during turbine operation in flow speeds of ≥2.3 ms−1 (mean reduction of 77% at the highest flow speed; 95% CI: 22%–93%).\nSynthesis and applications. The result showing that seals exhibit avoidance of the turbine during operation is important for industry developers and regulators, as lower numbers of seals close to the turbine reduces the potential for fatal collisions and injuries. The modelled reductions in presence can be used directly as avoidance rates in collision risk models to predict the impacts of future turbine arrays and de-risk the consenting process for this industry."

If the Detection Group Localiser is used with Logger Form annotations, species codes can be taken from the logger form.\nMade export of data (Calibrations, Deployments, Detections, and Localisations) available as ‘offline tasks’. This is not useful when running Tethys on a single dataset, since all tasks can be easily performed using ‘Export’ buttons on the main Tethys interface. However, this change means that these export tasks become available to the batch processor (Version 2.0 or above) which can be used to export data from multiple similar datasets without having to personally go into each one individually. See Tethys online help pages and help pages for the Batch processor for details.\nDeep Learning Classifier\nBetter error dialogs to indicate when models are incorrect and when the libraries have not been installed correctly.\nDelphinID Whistle classifier support now implemented.\nOther\nMade click detector offline click event data integrity checking available as offline task, so that this can be run prior to exporting data to Tethys.\nMultiple management changes to support batch processing of offline tasks.

    "section": "Changes to PAMGuard",
    "text": "Changes to PAMGuard\nMuch of the latest work is under the hood – however, users of the original module will notice a few UI changes. The original idea for the module was that we would support frameworks used to train models, such as AnimalSpot, Koogu, and Ketos. Anyone who trained their deep learning classifiers using these frameworks would have a model which would automatically be compatible with PAMGuard. What we found, though, was that most researchers did not use these frameworks and instead usually created their own bespoke models. On top of that, supporting each framework individually, including all the updates to each, was simply too much development work.\nTo remedy this, whilst keeping some framework support, we decided to take a different approach, allowing users multiple pathways to importing their models into PAMGuard. First, we fixed some fundamentals; instead of supporting multiple formats, we defined a metadata standard for PAMGuard compatible deep learning models, consulting developers of the other frameworks on what it should look like. It would then be up to the different frameworks to implement this standard if they wanted to be PAMGuard compatible.\nNext, we defined three clear ways in which users could import their models into PAMGuard:\n\nTraining their model using a supported framework such as Koogu.\nUsing a model which has been zipped up with the appropriate PAMGuard standard metadata. This can be shared independently or can be a model downloaded from our new page on the website where users can submit their own PAMGuard compatible models.\nUsing the new example model feature. We currently have two humpback whale and right whale models which can be selected by the user and are then automatically downloaded and set up by PAMGuard. The idea here was to provide a few example models to get folks started and allow them to easily test the module. We hope to add more example models with subsequent releases.\nImporting a “raw” model and manually defining the metadata (difficult - experts only !).\n\n\nHow to import your deep learning into PAMGuard"

Of 704 detected seal tracks, 347 occurred during turbine operation and 122 of these were detected directly upstream of the rotating blades in the horizontal plane. Using a series of repeatable and objective questions in a semi-automatic assessment, we characterised factors that were associated with a higher likelihood of collision and assessed the associated risk of collision between each seal track and the rotating blades. Thirty-five tracks (10% of tracks during operation) approached the rotor swept area within 10 m and 16 of these passed through the rotor swept area in the horizontal plane. There is strong evidence to suggest that most of these high-risk tracks passed above, around or possibly through, the turbine without collision. As well as providing useful data to assist in the prediction of collision risk, this approach provides a standardised method to evaluate similar data from other tidal energy sites or species. These outcomes can help inform the consenting process and support the sustainable development of the tidal energy industry."

    "text": "New Features\nUpdates to Tethys Interface\nUpdates to compatibility with Tethys Server version 3.2 beta 2 and Nilus 3.2. PAMGuard is no longer compatible with Tethys 3.1, the pre-release version.\nAdded Tethys functionality for the following modules: Whistle Classifier, Detection Group Localiser, Rocca, Click Train Detector, GPL Detector. If the Detection Group Localiser is used with Logger Form annotations, species codes can be taken from the logger form.\nMade export of data (Calibrations, Deployments, Detections, and Localisations) available as ‘offline tasks’. This is not useful when running Tethys on a single dataset, since all tasks can be easily performed using ‘Export’ buttons on the main Tethys interface. However, this change means that these export tasks become available to the batch processor (Version 2.0 or above) which can be used to export data from multiple similar datasets without having to personally go into each one individually. See Tethys online help pages and help pages for the Batch processor for details.\nDeep Learning Classifier\nBetter error dialogs to indicate when models are incorrect and when the libraries have not been installed correctly.\nDelphinID Whistle classifier support now implemented.\nOther\nMade click detector offline click event data integrity checking available as offline task, so that this can be run prior to exporting data to Tethys.\nMultiple management changes to support batch processing of offline tasks. Compatible with batch processor 2.0.\nAdded clip display for Deep Learning module.\nAdded optional display of impulse response function to IIR Filter design dialog in place of the pole-zero diagram.\nAdded ROCCA graphics, so ROCCA output can be displayed on the spectrogram display."

Event summary data is stored in the database and can also be exported to text files (e.g. for importing into the Distance software). \n’         Target motion analysis in two and three dimensions using a variety of models to fit the data (see help files for details).\n’         Toolbar with display species selection.\n’         Bearings can be calculated using the envelope of the waveform rather than the full waveform. The waveform or envelope can also be filtered prior to bearing calculation.\n’         Click species templates. Spectral templates may be generated / reloaded for different types of click.\n’         Click concatenated spectrogram display helps to view spectral properties of multiple clicks in an event.\nRaw Data Loading\nIn viewer mode, use the Acquisition control dialog to select the location of wav files associated with the data. This will unlock two useful features of the display:\n’         The spectrogram will automatically generate and display spectrogram data.\n’         The spectrogram display and the click detector will both allow you to play back sound via the system sound card.\nMinor Features and Bug Fixes\n’         The default preamplifier gain in the acquisition module has been changed to 0dN\n’         The Binary store now saves a complete data map between runs of the PAMGuard viewer. This leads to significant improvements in the time the viewer takes to load large data sets.\n’         DataMap: The click and the  whistle and moan detectors can now also show graphs of data density as a function of frequency instead of simple bar charts of data density vs. time (datagrams). This makes it much easier to find features such encounters with animals.\n’         Formatting of times in scroll bars has been improved (e.g. will say 15 m instead of 900s)\n’         The FFT Engine can now copy with FFT hops which are greater than the FFT length.\n’         The filter module can now also generate finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. Note however, that FIR filters may require considerably more execution time than IIR filters.\n’         Database support for MS Access 2007 and 2010 database formats.\n’         3D bearings from click detector using volumetric arrays. For small arrays (where the distance between elements is less than a few hundred samples) bearings are now correctly calculated in three dimensions.\n’         Main GUI frame no longer disappears behind other windows when viewer data are loaded.\n’         Toolbar with quick access to start / stop buttons.\n’         Filter and Decimator modules output data name. These were not unique in previous versions which made it impossible for downstream modules to connect to the correct data stream. This has been fixed.\n’         Whistle classifier has some new features in the classifier training panel. It is also now possible to export training data files directly from binary data files.\n’         The hydrophone localisation systems have been updated to better use information from true and magnetic heading sensors.\n’         The FFT module has been updated to ensure it finds it’s correct data source, even if that data source is loaded after the FFT module is created."

    "text": "Version 1.10.00 Beta December 2010\nNew features\n1. Binary storage module.\nPerforms a parallel role to the PAMGAURD database but uses binary files in a proprietary format which is considerably more efficient for data of unknown length such as whistle contours or small clips of click waveform. This feature is currently implemented in the following modules:\n’         Click Detector\n’         Whistle and Moan detector\n’         AIS\n2. Improved offline viewer functionality.\nThe offline viewer is much improved with better data scrolling and the ability to view data either stored in the database or the binary storage system. Work has stated on functions which read and use data stored in audio files. This is currently limited to re-calculating and displaying displaying spectrogram data during viewer mode operation. \n3. Heading sensor readout\nPAMGuard can now read true or magnetic heading data from gyro compasses, fluxgate compasses, etc. See help for details.\n4. Click detector offline event marking\nFunctionality for offline analysis, similar to that in RainbowClick is now partially incorporated into the PAMGuard click detector in viewer mode. Help files have not yet been developed for these features.\n5. Better support in the Decimator module for non-integer frequency division (i.e. previous versions would convert well from 96kHz to 48kHz, but not from 500kHz to 48kHz)\nBug fixes\n1. Placement of axes on some displays (array manager and depth side panel). Problem in 1.9.01 Beta now fixed.\n2. Fixed problems of NMEA read out not restarting after a serial drop out. NMEA now restarts correctly.\n3. Fixed a memory leak which caused occasional crashes, particularly when large numbers of files were processed offline.\n4. The correct file path separator is used in Sound recording names under Linux (which uses “/” as opposed to “\\” on Windows)."

    "text": "Version 1.9.00 Beta April 2010\nChannel numbering\nA new internal channel numbering scheme for ASIO sound cards was released on 8 March in Alpha version 1.8.02. These changes have now been promoted to this Beta release 1.9.00. These changes were described in an email to PAMGuard User, the text of which is repeated here:\nWithin PAMGuard, there have been constant problems with lookup tables relating hardware channel numbers to internal channel numbers. 99.9% of the time, this is not a problem since people are just reading channels 0 and 1 from a normal sound card or a list of channels 0,1,2,3, etc from an ASIO card or National Instruments card. However, when using the ASIO sound acquisition system, it is possible to read out hardware channels 2,3,4,5 say and those numbers would propagate through PAMGuard and be used by all the detectors. While this gave some clarity to  the displays, it also created a number of problems since look up tables were constantly required to relate hardware numbers and software numbers in every PAMGuard module. Since this type of channel numbering was only implemented several years into the PAMGuard project, it was never fully implemented or well supported by the different modules which resulted in a number of bugs which could cause confusion as to which hydrophones were being used during localisation or during calibrated measurement. The situation tended to only arise with a small number of ASIO sound cards such as the RME Fireface 400 on which the most useful inputs, the balanced line inputs, are hardware channels 4,5,6 and 7 on the back of the instrument. (On the Fireface 800, the balanced line inputs are channels 0 to 7). When using the National Instruments system, data were always sent into the rest of PAMGuard with sequential channel numbering starting at 0. This was required in order to support multiple NI Daq boards where it is possible to read for example channel 0 and 1 on two different devices, so to uniquely identify channels in the rest of PAMGuard, the only rational thing to do was to re-label those channels 0,1,2,3.\nThere have been other annoyances with the ASIO channel numbering scheme. For instance, if you had a configuration which worked in real time using channels 7 and 8 of a sound card, you could not use that same configuration to analyse wav files, which would always read their data as channels 0 and 1. Similarly if you switched sound cards, you may have to reconfigure every detector and several of the displays to handle the changes in channel numbering.\nI have spent a considerable amount of time trying to work out a better system for handling channel numbering in PAMGuard and have decided that the only practical thing to do is to force all software channel numbering back to a zero indexed system. i.e. even if you read out hardware channels 3,4,5 and 6, within PAMGuard, everywhere apart from the Sound acquisition dialog, you will see them listed as channels 0,1,2 and 3.  The consequences of doing this are mainly very good. Most users will not notice any changes. For those who need for some reason to read channel numbers not starting at zero things will be more stable. However, when you go to a new version with this new feature, it will be necessary to reconfigure all the modules in any existing configurations. To do this, open the configuration dialog for each module in turn and select the correct, zero indexed, channel number.\nOther Changes / new features\nPAMGuard Viewer\nThe way in which data are loaded for each module has changed in the PAMGuard viewer. In the scroll bar for each display, at the right hand end, there are buttons for pagingforward, backward and setting page length options.\nClick Detector Bearing Time display\nOlder versions used a vertical scroller in the right hand side of the main bearing time display to control the display length. This has been removed and replaced by a small control consisting of an edit box and a spinner (up and down arrows) at the right hand end of the horizontal scroll bar. The scroll system now also enabled you to scroll back through up to one minute of data during real time operation.\nWhistle and Moan Detector\nBearings are now written to the database.\nPAMGuard Viewer scrolling mechanism has changed.\nEach display now has a small control in the right hand end of a scroll bar or a slider which allows you to page through data. This is only well implemented for the map, but will be an increasingly important feature as more displays are set up for offline data viewing in future releases.\nViewer data map\nWhen using the PAMGuard viewer an additional panel will be displayed showing an overview of data quantity (per hour) from the various database tables connected to PAMGuard.\nSpectrogram Display overlays\nThe mechanism behind this has changed. Should not affect operations, but if you have problems with overlays on the spectrogram, please notify support@PAMGuard.org\nAll display overlays\nNow pick up line colours from the Display symbol manager, so it’s possible to set line colours by selecting a symbol with a particular line colour from the Display menu.\nDatabase\nDefault name for the Database module has changed from “ODBC Database” to just “Database”. This will not affect existing configurations.\nSound acquisition\nChanges made for a previous Mac build now incorporated into main Beta branch. This should allow for basic 2 channel sound acquisition using Macs.\nBug Fixes\nWhistle and Moan Detector\nWas not detecting sounds when noise reduction was performed in the Whistle Moan Detector, but was OK when noise reduction ran in the FFT module. This problem has been resolved.\nWhistle Classifier\nBug fix in database output. The first species probability column was setting to zero. This is now fixed\nIshmael Detectors\nBetter rendering of detection boxes on spectrogram display and more meaningful names in spectrogram display menu.\nSound acquisition\nWhen not using NI or AISO cards PAMAGUARD acquires sound using javax.sound which only supports two channels. Max number of channels now specified as 2 rather than undefined.\nSerial Comms\nA few changes so more through tidying up of resources when a port is closed. Might prevent a few problems when using a GPS."

    "text": "Version 1.8.01 Beta February 2010\nNew features\n’         Play back of high frequency wav files through National Instruments (NI) cards: When analysing wav files, sound can be output at high frequency (depending on the specification of the NI card). The primary motivation for this has been to develop a test bed for high frequency sound acquisition whereby we can play 500kHz recordings of harbour porpoise out of an NI card on one machine, into NI cards on a different machine which are testing high frequency versions of the click detector.\n’         Note that this does not (yet) permit simultaneous acquisition and playback through\n’         NI data acquisition cards.\nMinor features and bug fixes\n’         Synchronisation of FFT functions. Prevents threads accessing the same FFT module simultaneously which was occasionally causing crashes of the click detector if multiple hydrophone groups were being used.\n’         Pop up menus on click detector displays: some of these were not displaying correctly when running under Linux. This has been fixed. \nBug fixes\n’         patch panel can now output channels which are not in it’s input list.\n’         Null pointer trapped in Ishmael spectrogram correlation module.\n’         False buffer overflows at low sample rates stopped (size of data in individual data blocks had been increased at low sample rates, but when this exceeded 3s a false buffer overflow would occur)."

Clicks are NOT automatically displayed in the Winger window as they are for the waveform and spectrum windows since the Wigner transformation is very time consuming. Clicks will be displayed if you select them with the mouse.\n’         New click classifier methods, which include extraction of frequency sweep parameters. (Please note that this click is not yet documented. The old classifier is still available).\n’         Bearing ambiguity resolution for planar and volumetric arrays. New features in array dialog for estimations of errors on array location. These feed into to a maximum likelihood estimate of angles from small 2D or 3D sub arrays to give two polar angle coordinates. this can be used to resolve left right ambiguity and is implemented for both the click and the whistle/moan detectors. As a result, the click detector bearing time display can now be set to go from -180 to 180 degrees rather than 0 - 180 degrees. In this case, clicks in the upper half of the bearing display will be to port and clicks in the right half will be to starboard. As you pass a whale which is to port, the clicks will move UP the display. In the long term, I hope to turn this display around so that time is up the screen rather than across. \nSmall features and bug fixes\n’         Checks on Recordings and Clicks output folders before PAMGuard starts.\n’         Colours in spectrogram amplitude display correctly match the user selection.\n’         Default parameters in the radar display are for quiet clicks to be shown further away.\n’         Ishmael spectrogram correlation module checks for kernel creation and no longer crashes if the kernel is not present."

Click train detector uses a lot of memory and can cause out of memory errors.\n’         Ishmael spectrogram plug in graphics occasionally disappear when detection parameters are adjusted.\n’         The vertical scale on the raw data plug in display is incorrect.\n’         Sound recorder. 1/10 of a second of data are occasionally lost when the  recorder stops and restarts with a new file.\nNew Features in existing modules\n’         Window state remembered on shut down and window restored to same size  on start-up\n’         Show modules with no processes in viewer. This allows them to be renamed\n’         Better drawing of held spectrogram when putting mark rectangles on a spectrogram display. All panels are now correctly frozen. The rectangle is drawn in red on the marked panel and in green on other panels.\n‘         Spectrogram. Frequency information displayed in a ’hover’ box when the mouse is moved over the display. Choice of colour maps for display.\n’         Sound playback. Now supported in ASIO sound cards, so you can have sound coming in through the ASIO card and back out through its headphone socket (after passing through PAMGuard filters and other modules) at the same time.\n’         Operation will depend on the configuration of individual sound cards and how they are configured to mix incoming data with data from the PC. This is sometimes a physical switch on the card and sometimes a software configuration utility specific to that sound card.\n’         NMEA/GPS Simulator has options that set the start location, the speed, course, random course changes and whether or not AIS data are output\n’         (AIS Data are a fixed data set recorded in the English Channel).\nMultithreading\nPAMGuard now processes data in each module in a different processing thread. This allows PAMGuard to use both processor cores on dual or multi core processor machines. However, multithreading may still cause instability in some modules. An option is therefore accessible from the main Detection menu to enable and disable multithreading.\nNew Modules\nThe following new modules have been added to the Beta Release 1.2.0\nSound Processing\n1. Seismic Veto. A module for detecting and then cutting out very loud sounds.\nUtilities\n2. Depth Readout. Readout for analogue depth sensors using MeasurementComputing data acquisition devices.\nVisual Methods\n3. Video Range measurement. Will not capture video, but can open jpeg, bitmap files, etc. or you can paste in an image for video range analysis.\n4. Angle Measurement. Shaft angle encoding using Autonnic Research Ltd A3030 Absolute Rotary Encoder (good for measuring the angle of binocular stands).\n5. Fixed Landmarks. Enter and display fixed points for overlay on the map."

PAMGuard is no longer compatible with Tethys 3.1, the pre-release version.\nAdded Tethys functionality for the following modules: Whistle Classifier, Detection Group Localiser, Rocca, Click Train Detector, GPL Detector. If the Detection Group Localiser is used with Logger Form annotations, species codes can be taken from the logger form.\nMade export of data (Calibrations, Deployments, Detections, and Localisations) available as ‘offline tasks’. This is not useful when running Tethys on a single dataset, since all tasks can be easily performed using ‘Export’ buttons on the main Tethys interface. However, this change means that these export tasks become available to the batch processor (Version 2.0 or above) which can be used to export data from multiple similar datasets without having to personally go into each one individually. See Tethys online help pages and help pages for the Batch processor for details.\nDeep Learning Classifier\nBetter error dialogs to indicate when models are incorrect and when the libraries have not been installed correctly.\nDelphinID Whistle classifier support now implemented.\nOther\nMade click detector offline click event data integrity checking available as offline task, so that this can be run prior to exporting data to Tethys.\nMultiple management changes to support batch processing of offline tasks.

Array Files exported from array manager were not automatically getting the correct file end, making the exported files impossible to use. This is fixed and files will get the correct .paf end.\nIssue 167. File counter not resetting when restarting PAMGuard if it was paused during processing of folders of offline files. This has been updated to that a popup menu on the start button will allow you to continue from where you left off, or restart from the beginning.\nIssue 165. When re-opening folder selection dialog for processing folders of offline files, the folder name would be added a second time, meaning you got an invalid file path. This has been fixed.\nAt startup FFT Module checks channel list against incoming channel list from acquisition module and automatically removes channels that were selected in the FFT module, but are not available from the acquisition.\nDealt with issue in Tethys module looking up ITIS species codes where the progress dialog would not close.\nProject Information abstract field was not saving / reloading correctly in the configuration file.

Many people find that they want to further process PAMGuard data files to perform their own bespoke analysis, to extract data for statistical analysis, or to investigate ways to improve detectors and classifiers before going to the trouble of writing code in Java.\nThree language interfaces, written in Matlab, R, and Python, allow you to open PAMGuard binary files in each of these three languages so that you can write your own code to further process PAMGuard data.\n\n\n\nThis tutorial will teach you how to install the required libraries for you language of choice and take you through some worked examples that will show you how to read and plot data from single files, or folders containing multiple files.\nAfter that, it’s up to you ! Though if you’ve invented something fantastic and think that it should be incorporated into the PAMGuard core functionality, then please do get in touch.\n\n\n\nThese exercises assume that you’re familiar with basic programming in Matlab, R, or Python.\nThis tutorial is not suitable for beginners with PAMGuard. The Getting Started with PAMGuard and Introduction to static monitoring tutorials are recommended first.\n\n\n\nClick here to access the tutorial (web page).\nAll data used in this tutorial can be downloaded from Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17697843."

    "text": "Tethys is a temporal-spatial database for metadata related to passive acoustic studies. Unlike the PAMGuard databases, which hold a lot of detail about a single dataset, a Tethys database can hold summary data for many projects – that can be every project for you as an individual, your lab, or for multiple labs across a larger organisation.\n\n\n\nDeployments tab of the Tethys Data Explorer showing overall deployment effort of stationary moorings (colored circles) and survey track lines (blue lines)\n\n\nTethys does not replace existing PAMGuard databases and binary storage system since it’s not possible to get the level of detail PAMGuard uses during analysis into a single general database. However, the intent is that Tethys will contain enough detail for extensive meta-analysis across large temporal and spatial scales, eliminating (or at least minimising) the requirement for researchers to go back to the original PAMGuard data sets.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nYou will learn how to export data from PAMGuard to a Tethys database and to view the exported data both within PAMGuard and through the Tethys web interface.\n\nInstall Tethys and launch the Tethys Server\nAdd a Tethys module to PAMGuard and connect to the Tethys Server\nExport data from PAMGuard to Tethys, including:\n\nCalibration data\nDeployment data\nDetections\n\nView the exported data both from within PAMGuard and using the Tethys Web client\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial assumes reasonable working knowledge of PAMGuard. If you are not already familiar with PAMGuard, you should first complete the tutorial Introduction to PAMGuard.\n\n\nDownloads\nDetailed tutorial documentation is in TethysTutorial_V1.1.pdf\nA Zipped archive of processed binary data and PAMGuard database\nDownload Raw audio data files NOPPWavFiles.zip from the St Andrews university research portal."

    "text": "Information on the 2016 voluntary contribution system.\n\nThe PAMGuard Voluntary Contribution System\n\n\nPAMGuard maintenance and support is provided through the University of St Andrews by a team of specialists. Historically the maintenance and support function has been supported through direct E&P industry funding via the IOGP Sound and Marine Life Joint Industry Programme. It is anticipated this will cease in late 2016 and transition to a self-funding mechanism.\n\n\nWhat is the PAMGuard voluntary contribution?\n\n\nThe self-funding mechanism will be operated through user Contribution.  It is expected to/will replace previous direct funding from the oil industry, received through the IOGP Sound and Marine Life Joint Industry Programme (JIP). \n\n\nFunds are used by the PAMGuard team to provide basic support to industry users, fix any reported bugs and to provide general maintenance (for instance, ensuring compatibility with new Windows and Java versions).\n\n\nThe contribution is currently set at $5 per day - This amount was decided upon through consultation with PAM equipment/service providers and JIP/industry representatives. It is anticipated that this will achieve our financial target for the each year of US$77,000.\n\n\nWho is expected to contribute? \n\n\nWe expect to receive contributions from owners of PAM equipment that employs the PAMGuard software to detect, classify and localize marine life. Consultation with PAM stakeholders, suggest this will maximise the potential of receiving contributions from multiple E&P activities, across geographic regions being conducted by multiple companies.\n\n\nCurrently, these arrangements are being implemented within the oil & gas industry, particularly for seismic surveys, but we hope that it will be adopted by other offshore users, including the renewable energy sector, in the near future.\n\n\nIt is left to the discretion of individual companies whether to pass the contribution cost through the supply chain so that it is ultimately born by the companies commissioning activities offshore.\n\n\nThe contribution is voluntary, so companies have a choice not to participate, or only to contribute when working for clients who are prepared to contribute."
