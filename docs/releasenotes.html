<p>First official release for Mac OS11+, ARM Processors</p>
<section id="new-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<p>Added ability to export click events to the exporter.</p>
<p>Updates to deep learning module to deal with group detections.</p>
<p>New icons and graphical user interface style for Mac.</p>
</section>
<section id="bug-fixes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>Fixed important timing bug that affected offline analysis when there was a gap in data, causing certain binary files before the gap to be closed with an incorrect end time.</p>
<p>Fixed issue #177 with clip generator dialog always reverting to first available input source.</p>
<p>Removed unnecessary text output from DL classifier module.</p>
<p>Fixed units on spectrogram displays for air based measurements.</p>

<section id="version-2.02.14-october-2024" class="level1">
<h1>Version 2.02.14 October 2024</h1>
<section id="new-features-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features-1">New Features</h2>
<p>Rocca update: Ability to specify whether strong whistle/encounter threshold is applied as an absolute value, or as the difference between the highest and second-highest votes.</p>
<p>Tethys: Export of Group3D Localiser data</p>
</section>
<section id="bug-fixes-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bug-fixes-1">Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>Ishmael Matched Filter detector. Improved correlation algorithm to use correct data normalisation (and a faster FFT).</p>
<p>Ishamel detector graphics. Improved graphics (spectrogram plugins) to work when scrolling the spectrogram and to have better automatic scaling.</p>
<p>Folder processing: At startup, while PAMGuard catalogues the sound files, a progress bar is shown. This doesn’t change anything, or speed up the process, but does at least let the user know what’s happening (Issue 156).</p>
<p>No sound card ? If no sound cards are present on your computer (or if no headphones are attached, even though a sound card is present) when processing files offline, PAMGuard will still slow the analysis rate as it would if a soundcard were present.</p>
<p>Click Detector click selection on the display. Fixed issue with wrong click being selected when display was highly zoomed in (Issue 158).</p>
<p>File processing. Sometimes only processing last file when reprocessing data (issue 162).</p>
<p>Added ability for exporter to read annotations. Added ability to export CPOD and FPOD data.</p>
<p>Fixed various bugs in CPOD and FPOD displays and importer. Updated CPOD help file.</p>

<section id="version-2.02.13-august-2024" class="level1">
<h1>Version 2.02.13 August 2024</h1>
<section id="new-features-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features-2">New Features</h2>
<p>Deep Learning Classifier. Major upgrade to support for Deep Learning models in PAMGuard. See online help for details.</p>
<p>Click detector: Remembers locations of displays and doesn’t continually reset them.</p>
<p>Help for Matched Click Classifier.</p>
<p>Project information dialog. This allows capture of essential project information to store with your data. See menu item Settings/Project information.</p>
<p>‘Effort’ management system. New map options allow colouring of track line by ‘effort’ from various other modules. This is currently the acquisition system (so the track will change colour when PAMGuard is running), the binary store system (likely the same as the acquisition) or data from Logger forms. This system will be extended to other modules in the near future.</p>
<p>Added a new exporter which allows users to export data to .mat (MATLAB, Python), .RData (open in R) or .wav files (open in Sonic Visualiser, Audacity etc.)</p>
</section>
<section id="tethys-database" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tethys-database">Tethys Database</h2>
<p>Many users will be aware that we’re integrating an interface to the <a href="https://tethys.sdsu.edu/">Tethys Database</a> into PAMGuard. Some basic features are available for testing. If interested, please contact the PAMGuard support team.</p>
</section>
<section id="bug-fixes-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bug-fixes-2">Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>Linking clicks to offline clicks table. We had a database that had become corrupted so added code to relink offline clicks to their corresponding clicks from binary data.</p>
<p>Drawing non-acoustic data: Data that were not associated with any hydrophones, e.g.&nbsp;visual sightings in Logger forms were not drawing on the map. This fixed and PAMGuard will use the vessels GPS position as reference.</p>
<p>Lookup tables: fix feature which was causing table entries to repeat.</p>
<p>Click Train Detector: Add exception handlers to avoid errors as PAMGuard stops / restarts.</p>
<p>Group Detection starts and ends: Check data integrity function fixed and now inserts correct times of start and ends of events into database.</p>
<p>Clip generator. Changes to ensure PAMGuard keeps audio data long enough to make clips. In some circumstances data were being discarded too early so clips could not be created.</p>
<p>Acquisition “Skip initial seconds” feature, designed to remove high sample levels e.g.&nbsp;from calibration tones at start of a soundtrap recording was not working with the click detector. This is fixed but replacing all data with 0’s and still sending data. Note that this may lead to artificially low noise measures at the start of a file.</p>
<p>Data reprocessing options. Updated to ensure that the option “Start normally. Note risk of overwriting!” is always available. Also improved code naming binary files to attempt to push them to exact times, rather than a couple of seconds after the hour.</p>
<p>improved code naming binary files to attempt to push them to exact times, rather than a couple of seconds after the hour.</p>
<p>Updated icons to improve display on high definition screens.</p>
<p>SAIL Daq Card. Automatic restart when DAQ card stalls (happening increasingly often with latest Windows updates)</p>

<section id="version-2.02.10-january-2024" class="level1">
<h1>Version 2.02.10 January 2024</h1>
<section id="new-features-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features-3">New Features</h2>
<p><strong>Importing modules</strong> from other configurations: New options from file menu allowing import of specific modules, or module settings from other configurations. E.g. if you had three similar configurations and had set one of them up with a new detector, or got the click classifier settings set up just right in one of those configurations, you can import the additional modules or the click detector settings easily into the other configurations.</p>
<p><strong>Improved SUD (soundtrap compressed files) file performance</strong> when scrolling through audio data in Viewer mode.</p>
<p><strong>Viewer Launch</strong> by right clicking on sqlite database and selecting “open with / PAMGuard ViewerMode” launcher menu option.</p>
</section>
<section id="bug-fixes-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bug-fixes-3">Bug Fixes</h2>
<p><strong>Logger Forms</strong></p>
<p>Boolean (logical true/false, yes/no) data were not showing correctly in Viewer mode. Now fixed</p>
<p>Data selectors for plotting on map were not working, also fixed</p>
<p>Bearing localizer running offline was not correctly saving updated bearings to the database. Now fixed.</p>
<p><strong>ROCCA Classifier fixes</strong></p>
<p>Allow Rocca to run without classifiers: Fixed bug that threw an error if no classifier files were &nbsp;specified in Rocca Params dialog</p>
<p>Fix memory issue with RoccaContourDataBlocks not being released for garbage collection</p>
<p>Set RoccaContourDataBlock objects to null and stop PamObserver Timer to</p>
<p>force release</p>
<p>Fix problem tracing whistles in Rocca spectrogram pop-up: Whistle and raw data were being cleared before the user had time to trace out the whistle, causing PAMGuard to throw an exception.&nbsp; Both were already being cleared when the pop-up window is closed, so no need to do it here.</p>
<p><strong>DIFAR Module</strong>: Bug crashing the module with null pointer errors fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Whistle Detector</strong>: Fixed bug which caused the detector to slow to almost zero speed when large complex sounds with many branches were detected.</p>
<p><strong>Click Detector Offline Event Marking</strong>: Fixed problem of events not being correctly deleted and also of clicks not being correctly reassigned to different events.</p>
<p><strong>Screen Position</strong>: When using multiple monitors, if you move a configuration to a computer with a different monitor layout, the GUI should work out if it’s opening on a screen area which no longer exists and move itself onto the primary monitor.</p>
<p><strong>File Folder Processing</strong>: Previous version had a bug which caused files to not always be sorted into the correct order for processing. This caused some instability in some detectors, causing memory leaks when new data arrived with time stamps earlier than already processed data in memory. This is now fixed – files are ow correctly sorted alphabetically by file name, i.e.&nbsp;not including the name of the folder containing the files.</p>

<section id="bug-fixes-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bug-fixes-4">Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>Time zone displays: Fixed some bugs associated with options to have PAMGuard display times in local time, rather than UTC. This was affecting times typed into the scroll bars of displays which were reading local time, even when set to use UTC.</p>

<section id="bug-fixes-5" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bug-fixes-5">Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>ROCCA Memory Leak: A memory leak in ROCCA, which mostly occurred when processing large datasets of many offline files, has been fixed.</p>
<p>Data Map: “Scroll To Data” pop-up menu, which didn’t always scroll to the correct place, is now fixed.</p>
<p>Bearing Localiser offline: If reprocessing bearings, the localizer was not correctly loading required raw or FFT data to input to the cross correlation algorithm. This is now fixed so that you can reprocess bearings in viewer mode.</p>
<p>Map files: Added additional exception handlers to handle corrupt map files.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features-4">New Features</h2>
<p>Restart Options: When you restart processing of offline files, if output data already exist (binary data of within database tables) you will be asked if you want to overwrite the data, cancel, or try to continue from where to left off.</p>
<p>Updated SoundTrap sud file interface so that PAMGuard now extracts and stores the Click Detector settings from the sud files and stores them within the PAMGuard configuration. This does not affect processing, but is important for record keeping.</p>
<p>GPS options to use any valid RMC or GGA string. Not all GPS receivers output their RMC data as GPRMC – e.g.&nbsp;some may output as GNRMC. A new option allows the GPS module to use any string, whatever the first two characters of the string name may be.</p>

<p>Use of localization sensor and orientation data for static hydrophones had a bug whereby it would continually ‘forget’ angle offsets applied to static hydrophones in viewer mode. This is now fixed.</p>
<p>Click tool bar: Correctly shows event selection options even if no species classification options are in place.</p>
<p>Fixed Landmarks: Earlier versions were ‘losing’ these every time PAMGuard started or new data were loaded in viewer mode. Now fixed.</p>
<p>ROCCA: Fixed (another) memory leak which caused PAMGuard to crash when processing large data sets with the ROCCA classifier.</p>
<p>Ishmael Modules: Fixed bug which occasionally caused crashes when processing many files offline.</p>
<p>PAMDog: Fixed bug in watchdog program which was trying to start PAMGuard before modules were fully loaded. The watchdog now correctly waits until modules are loaded before attempting to start PAMGuard processing.</p>

<p>Two memory leaks:</p>
<p>A memory leak has been found which seems to mostly occur in Viewer mode. Some data on background noise measurements are not being cleared from memory, so memory will eventually run out. This could happen after browsing a lot of data, but was most likely when reprocessing files offline, for example running click classifiers. This is now fixed.</p>
<p>Also fixed a memory leak in the ROCCA whistle classification module.</p>

<p>SoundTrap SUD file reading. If you’re using SoundTrap autonomous recorders from Ocean Instruments, you no longer need to decompress the SoundTrap files prior to processing. This will save time and a lot of disk space. Extraction of clicks from the inbuilt SoundTrap Click detector can also happen while processing SUD file data with other detectors, thereby streamlining the whole processing chain.

<p>Some minor bug fixes following our migration to GitHub. Note that the older Bug numbers only refer to bugs reported on the SVN site. New bugs and issues are logged on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PAMGuard/PAMGuard/issues" class="uri">https://github.com/PAMGuard/PAMGuard/issues</a>. GitHub issue number are referred to with a # symbol</p>
<p>#6 Threading Hydrophone Locator: was not working correctly in the latest release V2.02.02. The problem was particularly apparent in Viewer mode but may have given false array locations in normal mode under some circumstances. This has been fixed</p>
<p>#11 Matched Click Classifier: fixed bug which caused crash running in real time. Added template names based on file names.</p>
<p>#13 Merging files when offline processing file folders: Had an error introduced in last release which caused it to fail to recognise gaps between files, meaning that some output data (i.e.&nbsp;after a gap) would have an incorrect time stamp. This did not affect data if the ‘merge contiguous files’ option was not selected.</p>
<p>#14 Logger forms data were not plotting correctly. This was due to the required data selection functions not being fully implemented. This is now fixed and it should be possible to select what to plot based on selections from drop down lists within any form.</p>
<p>Note that updates have also been made to the Matlab interface to PAMGuard binary files, which has now also been migrated to GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PAMGuard/PAMGuardMatlab" class="uri">https://github.com/PAMGuard/PAMGuardMatlab</a>.</p>

<h1>Version 2.02.01 October 2021</h1>
<p><strong>If you are upgrading from a PAMGuard core release (1.15.xx), PAMGuard Version 2 contains major updates. You should read and understand the notes listed for <a href="#_Latest_Beta_Version_2.00.10">Beta Version 2.00.10</a> before proceeding with installation and use of this version.</strong></p>
<p>This version of PAMGuard has been bundled with Java 16 (OpenJDK release), so you will not need to install a java runtime engine separately. PSFX files generated in previous beta releases (2.xx.xx) should be compatible with this version, and vice-versa. PSF files generated in core releases (1.15.xx) can be loaded in this version, but will be converted to PSFX files when PAMGuard exits.</p>
<section id="file-format-change" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="file-format-change">File Format Change</h2>
<p>Changes have been made to the binary file format to support the output of additional noise outputs for certain detectors (See below). Binary files created with this version will not be compatible with earlier versions 2.01.### and below. This version will read and may convert earlier format binary files.</p>
<p><strong>Localisation Modules</strong></p>
<p>Bearing and Group 3D localization modules have been thoroughly tested and a number of bugs rectified. Documentation has been developed and is available in the online help. Further, a number of example configurations have been generated, configuration files for these are available in the PAMGuard downloads area <a href="http://www.PAMGuard.org/downloads.php?cat_id=3">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Detection Group Localiser</strong></p>
<p>This module has been renamed “Detection Grouper”, so as to avoid confusion with the Group 3D localizer. This is because the Detection Grouper is more for organizing data into groups to be localized than it is for doing localization.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug &nbsp; 490. Error when trying to select File in Sound Acquisition.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug &nbsp; 491. LTSA spectrogram frequency axis does not update when changing the params</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrade database system to work with MySQL 8.0</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements to datamap display, to ensure even small images will be shown</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow Clip Generator to create both a binary record and a wav file</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implemented a Backup Manager for backing up multiple types of data to multiple locations]</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades to how PAMGuard lets the user enter custom date formats in the Sound Acquisition dialog</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extended XML-output support to all of the modules</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Updates to the simulated sounds in the Sound Acquisition module</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades to the Symbol Manager framework, to give more control over colours and symbols</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added an option to hide the ship on the map</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update Rocca module to allow operation without a classifier (in case all you need are the measurements)</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update whistle and moan detector to better handle small stubs or spurs coming off the side of whistles</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extend the Hyperbolic Localiser to handle 2D planar arrays (previously limited to 3D volumetric arrays)</p>

<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better interpolation of data by the Decimator when decimating/upsampling by a non-integer amount</p>
<p>16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noise Level Outputs - as an aid to performance diagnosis, some detectors (currently the GPL, Click Detector and Whistle and Moan Detector) are outputting additional noise metrics to their binary output files. These can be read with the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/PAMGuard/files/Matlab/">PAMGuard Matlab library</a> and used to diagnose system performance in varying noise conditions. Improved displays within PAMGuard for these noise metrics will be included in a future release.</p>
<p>17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An implementation of the Generalized Power Law Detector, developed by Tyler Helble ([Helble et al., ‘A generalized power-law detection algorithm for humpback whale vocalizations’, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol.&nbsp;131, no. 4, pp.&nbsp;2682–2699, 2012) is now available. For details, see the online help</p>
<p>18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Deep Learning module for sound classification is now available. This allows users to deploy a large variety of deep learning models natively in PAMGuard.

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functionality to clone hydrophone streamers.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added automatic log file - all messages to the console will now be written to a txt file as well. File is stored in user.home/PAMGuard folder - look under the Help menu item for a shortcut to open the folder.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implemented a simple UDP output for PAMGuard alarms.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes to Spectrogram Mark Observers, to allow individual channels to be selected instead of the spectrogram panel as a whole.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change to use long module names in dialogs instead of short, to make it easier to know the difference between output data blocks when using the same module multiple times.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added a few new options to the Click Detector Sweep Classifier.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add option to the Map module’s Plot Overlay Options dialog, to show events occuring in the future (<em>look ahead</em>) instead of the default display of events which have already occurred. Can make it easier to match up the map with clicks seen in the Click Detector display.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 381. Logger form loses controls when the order is changed.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 382. Click species check boxes get cleared in toolbar when the Click Classification dialog is closed</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 383. Spectrogram max frequency resetting to incorrect value the first time the spectrogram dialog is opened.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 385. Bug in offline toolbar which will crash if the classifier dialog is opened and then closed with no classifiers specified.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 386. Click Detector Sweep Classifier sometimes keeping changed settings even when user tries to cancel or discard changes</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 387. Map was stopping displaying data based on the start time of data units. Have changed this to last updated time so that click events will display if they have been recently modified. Otherwise, long events get lost from the display.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 388. Spectrogram annotations not working properly in beta branch. Would make and store mark, but not store snr or notes. Both now fixed for both online and offline operations. Have also added some options controlling SNR measurement period.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 389. Multiple annotations of the same class would not be stored to the database if they had the same class. This was affecting the Spectrogram Annotation module which has now been given two text type annotations.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 391. Click Detector not registering change in multi-threading option.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 392. Click Detector throwing exception if multi-threading is turned off and the Basic Sweep Classifier is testing the amplitude range.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 393. Rocca module not calculating energy, duty cycle, and windowRMS values when manually picking contour points.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 394. Occasional divide-by-0 error in Spectrogram Display time scale.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 395. Problem with hydrophone locator was resulting in an incorrect x position for hydrophone 0.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrades</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better way of coupling scrollers in User Display panels - see new options in main menu.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added Matched Template Click Classifier. Classifies clicks based on an ideal template to match and a template to reject. An example of this is to classify beaked whale clicks in an environment with dolphin clicks.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added zoom in/out to Raw Data plugin display in spectrogram.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added ability to read differential GPS data.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added check for duplicate settings in the psf file when exiting PAMGuard. If duplicate settings are found, user is given the option to leave them in the psf or get rid of them. Duplicate settings are ignored by PAMGuard, but can cause the psf file to grow large over time.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New features in PAMGuard Beta mean that psf files created with new versions are not compatible wth earlier versions and all configuration data may be lost if an attempt is made to open newly created psf files with older versions. We have therefore changed the file extension of psf files to .psfx in new Beta releases. Beta releases will still load the older psf files, but when the configuration is saved, the original psf file will remain untouched and data will be written to a psfx file with the same directory and name.</p>

<p>PAMGuard Version 2 contains major updates. You should read and understand these notes before proceeding with installation and use of this version. These changes have been funded under contract to NOAA Fisheries, contract no. WE-133F-16-SE-1126.</p>
<section id="binary-file-structural-changes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="binary-file-structural-changes">Binary File Structural Changes</h3>
<p>The Binary File structure has changed to accommodate additional information for each unit of data stored. This means that any data generated with PAMGuard Version 2.00.00 and above will not be compatible with older versions of PAMGuard. If you open older data sets with the PAMGuard Viewer the older data will be converted to the new format (see below for details).</p>
<p>The most significant change in the binary file format is the addition of a Unique Data Identifier (UID) to each unit of data. This is intended to aid in offline analysis by making it easier for the user to link what they are seeing on different PAMGuard displays and also to link with any data post processed in Matlab or other custom analysis software. UID’s are also added to PAMGuard database tables.</p>
<section id="converting-old-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="converting-old-data">Converting Old Data</h4>
<p>If old data are opened with the PAMGuard viewer they will automatically be converted. For safety, the original binary files will not be overwritten and the new data will be placed in a new folder on your computer with the same path as the old data, but suffixed with ‘_WithUID’, e.g.&nbsp;if your binary data were previously stored in the folder C:\MySurvey\binarydata the new data will be written to C:\MySurvey\binarydata_WithUID.</p>
<p>The additional UID column will be added to all database tables and populated with unique values. For data which are stored in both the binary files and in database tables, the same UID’s will be used in both data stores.</p>

<section id="new-displays" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-displays">New Displays</h3>
<p>A new time based scrolling display has been added to PAMGuard which can display multiple types of data on the same time axis. It can for instance be used to display bearings to whistles on a bearing-time type display similar to that commonly used in the click detector. Composite display graphs containing data from more than one detector are also possible. For details, see the PAMGuard help file (Displays / Time Display FX). Note that this display is only available if you are running Java 8 or later.</p>

<section id="event-marking-and-the-detection-group-localiser" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="event-marking-and-the-detection-group-localiser">Event Marking and the Detection Group Localiser</h3>
<p>A new system of event marking which can be used both online and offline has been added to PAMGuard. Details are in the PAMGuard help file (Displays/Display Marking). Data can be selected on the Map, the Spectrogram Display and the new Time Display FX in a similar way and sent to other PAMGuard modules. The new marking and data selection system works with the new Detection Group Localiser. The Detection Group Localiser extends the functionality which always existed in the click detector to other types of data (e.g.&nbsp;Whistles) so that they can be grouped and tracked using target motion analysis in a similar way. Details of the Detection Group Localiser are in the PAMGuard help files (Localisation/Detection Group Localiser).</p>
</section>
<section id="display-colours" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="display-colours">Display Colours</h3>
<p>A new system for handling display colours has been implemented across all PAMGuard displays. This gives greater flexibility to the user to control how data units are shown. For instance, you might simply want to show clicks in blue and whistles in green. However, for clicks and whistles that have been assigned to a Detection Group, you may want to colour them by the colour assigned to the group.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-old-pamguard-configurations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-old-pamguard-configurations">Using Old PAMGuard Configurations</h3>
<p>Old PAMGuard configurations will work with the new version. However please note the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New classes will be added to the configuration files, so they will no longer work with older PAMGuard versions.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display colour options will be lost and most data displayed on the map may default to black. This is due to the above changes to how colours are managed. Changing back to the colours of your choice is relatively simple through the PAMGuard GUI.</p>

<section id="version-1.15.11-may-2017" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.11 May 2017</h1>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 317. Rocca Module Data Purging. The ROCCA module was not performing data purging when using classifiers developed for Hawaii/Temperate Pacific/North Atlantic datasets. This has been corrected.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 320. PAMGuard stopped reading Click Detector Event data from database when target motion analysis information was encountered. Corrected.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 321. Problem reading Soundtrap 4 files. Fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrades</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added Copy-to-Clipboard button to Warning dialogs, to store error messages and stack trace information on the Windows clipboard. This information can then be easily pasted into emails, text documents, etc when contacting PAMGuard support.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancements and bug fixes made to Difar module during 2017 ACE voyage.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocca Module: added StartHr, ProportionWhists and ProportionClicks parameters to Event classifier</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The installer now allows the user to enter command line switches/parameters to be included in *.ini files.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.15.10-march-2017" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.10 March 2017</h1>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 308. Map Overlay Control. Storage of data saying what get’s plotted on each map and for how long became corrupted and the list grew to a ridiculous size. Code has been put in place to a) stop it happening again and b) to repair any configuration files which are corrupted. Corrupted files will be slow to load, slow to save and will be &gt; several megabytes in size. It may be necessary to delete the PAMGuardSettings table in any databases since these too may have become oversized which will slow down viewer mode PAMGuard start-up.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 309. Rocca would crash when the user would press the classify button after the contour was recalculated. This has been corrected.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 310. When exiting Viewer mode, PAMGuard queries the user whether they are sure they want to exit without saving even though they selected <em>Save and Exit</em>. Corrected, and added an <em>Exit without Save</em> option.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 311. When double-clicking on a psf file to start PAMGuard, the working directory is set as the location of the psf and not as the installation folder. The library subfolder (\lib or \lib64) uses a relative path from the working folder, and therefore is set incorrectly. This has been fixed.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 314. If PAMGuard is started by double-clicking on a psf, nothing happens when the user selects save as new configuration. This has been fixed.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 315. code searched for file in working folder, which is the installation folder when starting PAMGuard using a shortcut link. But when double-clicking on a psf, the working folder is the location of the psf. This has been fixed.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug 316. Another error reading metadata for Dtag and SoundTrap files has occurred due to a format change in dTag metadata. This has been fixed.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.15.09-january-2017" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.09 January 2017</h1>
<p><strong>BugFixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 306. Certain methods have been querying AcousticDataUnit.getDuration and expecting to receive a response in milliseconds. However, getDuration actually returns the number of samples. &nbsp;This has been corrected.</p>
<p><strong>Plug-Ins</strong></p>
<p>A major change in this version of PAMGuard is how plug-ins are managed. PAMGuard now has the ability to dynamically load plug-in modules (saved as jar files) at runtime. This will greatly simplify the process of testing and distributing newly developed modules, since only a small jar file will be required rather than a new bespoke PAMGuard installation.</p>
<p>Module code development remains largely unchanged, in most cases simply requiring the addition of an interface class. &nbsp;Instructions for the development of new modules utilizing the plug-in system can be found <a href="http://www.PAMGuard.org/16_HowtomakePlug-Ins.html">here</a>. &nbsp;Plug-in modules can be downloaded from the PAMGuard website here, but developers are encouraged to host and maintain their own modules.</p>
<p>Modules of interest to the general PAM community will remain as part of the core PAMGuard installation. However, specialized modules which are useful to only a small number of users have been removed and are available as a separate download. The following modules have been removed:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resource Monitor</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WILD ArcGIS Interface</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workshop Demo Detector</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Echo Detector and IPI Demo (bundled together, due to dependencies)</p>
<p><strong>Other Changes</strong></p>
<p>The installer has been updated to handle both 64 bit and 32 bit installations. PAMGuard psf files are now registered in the Windows Registry, so double-clicking on a psf file should run PAMGuard in normal mode (as opposed to Viewer or Mixed modes). Note that the Windows Registry can only hold a single executable reference for psf files; therefore, for users with multiple installations of PAMGuard, double-clicking on a psf will run the most-recently installed version of PAMGuard on the system.</p>

<h1>Version 1.15.08 November 2016</h1>
<p>This release contains one bug fix.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 307. Unpacker for Sound trap dwv files was not working correctly. This is now fixed.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.15.07-november-2016" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.07 November 2016</h1>
<p>This release contains two bug fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 303. Some ASIO sound cards not working with either ASIO system in PAMGuard. For the PAMGuard ASIO system, this was due to a data format used by some sound cards never being properly implemented. For the “New ASIO system” which is based on jAsioHost, the unpacking of that format contained a bug which returned incorrect numbers, so data were swamped with noise. Both systems are now fixed. By preference, users should use the PAMGuard ASIO system since the JAsioHost based system seems to drop samples when many channels are running at high sample rate.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 305. Date and Time not being correctly extracted from wav files created using SoundTrap recorders. Fixed by correctly finding and unpacking information in the accompanying xml log files that come with SoundTrap files.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.15.06-november-2016" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.06 November 2016</h1>
<p>This release contains bug fixes from release 1.15.05, mostly concerning the new target motion analysis methods. Bugs were found in several places in the system, affecting calculations using all three methods: Least Squares, 2D Simplex and 3D Simplex. To the best of our knowledge, all issues are now resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 291. Click Detector Click Classifier: If this is set to “none” the click detector will freeze / crash and will put the psf file into a state where it will never load again. Incredibly, this bug seems to have been in place for several years and no one has come across it until now. It’s fixed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 292. Incorrect labels on Target Motion panel in viewer - 3D algorithm was labelled as 2D.Fixed</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 293. Errors displayed in the click detector target motion panel were wrong in the graphics for the Simplex localisers and wrong in the tabulated data for the least square model. Both fixed.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 294. Click classifier was crashing when the ‘min amplitude’ option was used. This is fixed.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 295. If a click has a total length of a single sample, the code attempting to estimate the time delay between channels would crash. This is now fixed. This could only occur if both pre sample and post sample were set to 0 in the click detector, which is generally not a good idea, so this bug may have been there for some time, it’s just that no one noticed before. Fixed</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 296. Context menu popping up in click detector when marking clicks in Viewer mode. This has been fixed so that in viewer mode, the menu will only appear when you right click on the display.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 297. Airgun display was not correctly showing itself at fixed locations, but always following the vessel track. This is now fixed.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 299. Threading Hydrophone locator. Bug found in hydrophone heading calculation has been fixed.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 300. GUI Tab panel selections were not being restored correctly when PAMGuard displays were split across multiple frames. Fixed.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 301. Multiple errors in the target motion module have been fixed.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 302. Target motion calculations taking too long when many clicks are included in a track. Mostly a problem when using automatic click train id. Fixed by setting an optional maximum number of clicks to use in a track.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.15.05-september-2016" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.05 September 2016</h1>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 273. Sound files in viewer data map. These were not being correctly catalogues in the datamap when using the PAMGuard viewer which meant that PAMGuard was not correctly loading sound data during offline analysis. This is now fixed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 287. Slow database. This has been solved by setting the default behavior of the database to have Auto Commit set to ‘off’</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 288. Fixed problem of missing help file image</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 290. Click bearings on spectrogram display plug in were reversed if the first hydrophone was behind the second hydrophone in the configuration. This is now fixed so that it displays the same bearings as the main click detector display.</p>
<p><strong>Target Motion Analysis</strong></p>
<p>A major piece of work has been undertaken to improve the Target Motion tracking with PAMGuard. Details are available in the online help. Users of the Click Detector will notice the following changes:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is now a choice of least squares and Simplex based algorithms for real-time animal tracking. The improved algorithms also provide better error information both for display on the map and for storage in the database.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of data streams associated with the click detector has been tidied up so that there are a) All Click, b) Tracked Clicks (those which are part of an event) and c) Events.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When tracking online, all the click marking information is written to the same database tables as are used for offline target motion analysis. This means than when reviewing data offline, the tracks created in real time are now available for review and further analysis.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of user options are now available for automatic click train identification and tracking.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The automatic click train identification is now using the same internal structures as the manual tracking, so it’s possible to combine automatic and manual tracking.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved options are available to the user, via the click detector bearing time display, to correct and relabel clicks / entire click trains.</p>
<p>Developers will hopefully find that the target motion code has been improved in a way which will make it much easier to provide target motion localization for other detection types (e.g.&nbsp;whistles) in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong></p>
<p><em>Logger Form Design</em></p>
<p>A GUI driven system for designing Logger forms has been released. Currently, this feature has no online help, but is reasonably intuitive compared to the old method of typing directly into the database.</p>
<p><em>Improved Number handling</em></p>
<p>Users have often found that PAMGuard can be ‘jumpy’, i.e.&nbsp;the spectrogram does not scroll smoothly, but pauses for a second every few seconds. This is caused by the Java garbage collector cleaning up unused objects in memory. With 64 bit versions, which allow for more memory, some of these pauses were becoming quite long (due to the increased amount of memory that needed to be cleaned up). In some circumstances, these pauses were making data acquisition systems unstable. We have therefore entirely rewritten the way in which PAMGuard handles arrays of spectrogram data (complex numbers) so that instead of large numbers of small Java objects there are now fewer, larger, simpler java objects. These reduce processing delays for garbage collection and give an overall speed improvement, but will otherwise not be noticed by users.</p>
<p><em>Click Detector RainbowClick file output</em></p>
<p>This feature has been removed since it has been obsolete for several years. Users should use the PAMGuard binary storage system for Click Detector data.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.15.04-july-2016" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.04 July 2016</h1>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>A number of bug fixes and code improvements have been made since V 1.15.03:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 272. File types: Some File Open / File Save dialogs were allowing selection of all file types. e.g.&nbsp;Save Configuration As, Section of whistle classifier training file, Map file Selection, These have now been changed so that only the correct type of file can be selected.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 274. GPS Memory leak. A Memory leak associated with GPS data collection has been found which could cause PAMGuard to run out of memory after a day or two’s operation. This has now been fixed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 275. Painting of thumbnail on the Map display time slider. Have fixed a small problem in the graphical display. The visibility of components on this slider has also been improved and a log time scale option is available to facilitate in map data display.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 276. The default hydrophone sensitivity was -201dB re 1V/uPa. This was supposed to be used with a default preamp gain of 30dB. For some reason gain was no longer being added. We have therefore set a default sensitivity of -170dB and left gain at zero. This is more typical of many hydrophones in use today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 277. Text fields in classifier dialog were not large enough to display times greater than 10ms. We have increased length of text fields in the dialog.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 278. Have future proofed against potential binary file format changes in future releases. New PAMGuard releases will always be able to open older binary files, however, with previous PAMGuard releases if a newer file format was opened, then PAMGuard was unable to check that the file format was newer and would attempt to read the files and might even corrupt them. Now it will recognise that it cannot open the files, display appropriate error messages and not attempt to read the files. NOTE that at this time there are no planned file format changes and that this is purely a future proofing exercise.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 279. GUI Resizing: The whole PAMGuard GUI would suddenly resize to something very small when a dialog is opened. This has been traced to improper use of a common dialog component SourcePanel which tries to repack its parent Window. Some programmers had inadvertently set it to repack the main PAMGuard GUI instead. This has been Fixed.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 280. Recorder control option to automatically restart recording were causing confusion. It was working in that the recorder would return to its previous state, but it was sometimes difficult for users to set it so that recording would always start as soon as PAMGuard started. More sensible and easy to understand options have been developed in a new options dialog.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 281. Click classification dialog has grown too big to fit on the screen. The options have now been split across three tabbed panes which solves the problem.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 282. Quiet clicks causing too many false classifications. An additional option has been added to the click classifier to limit a class to a range of amplitude.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 283. The spectrogram display was not displaying data in Viewer mode. This has been traced to a problem in offline data mapping and has been fixed.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.15.03-april-2016" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.03 April 2016</h1>
<p>A single bug fix concerning import from Access databases to SQLite.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 271. Problem 1 was that the incorrect settings were being imported into the new database. Problem 2 was that indexing of imported click events in the new database was incorrect. Both these issues have now been fixed.</p>

<h1>Version 1.15.02 March 2016</h1>
<p>A number of small bug fixes following release of 1.15.00.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 266. Clip generator crashed in viewer when the path for output files was not defined even if files were not being created. Fixed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 267. Click detector not calculating correct bearings when multiple hydrophone pairs with different separations were used. Fixed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 268. ROCCA module was not saving WAV file clips. Fixed.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 269. Whistle and Moan detector paired bearing localiser was not working. This localizer searches for matching whistles on pairs of hydrophones. Bearings from each pair are crossed to create a localization. Fixed.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 270. Improved file names display in PAMGuard Viewer offline data map and datagram creation.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.15.00-february-2016" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.15.00 February 2016</h1>
<p>Beta Version 1.15.00 64 bit and Core version 1.15.00 32 bit. Both using identical Java core software but linking to different libraries for control of sound input devices.</p>
<p>This is the first release of a 64 bit version of PAMGuard. As with the 32 bit version a number of C language libraries are required to interface to external sound cards and other data acquisition devices. These have been extensively tested on several different computers, but may not be as stable as the 32 bit versions. Please report any problems immediately to the PAMGuard team.</p>
<p><strong>Other Changes</strong></p>
<p>Updated the configuration file WMM.COF for World Magnetic Model to the latest 2015-2020 version. See https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml</p>
<p>Small changes to the ROCCA classification module:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove white spaces and parenthesis characters from RoccaContourStats header row</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Report ‘N/A’ for min time between detections, if there is only 1 detection</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add ability to load standard notes and use in RoccaParameters dialog window</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed Rocca multi-threading problem which caused Click Detector to send same click multiple times</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 253. Database import fails when Access database contains queries. Fixed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 254. Lookup lists failing in imported SQLite databases. This was caused by the system ‘padding’ topic’s with blank spaces and is now fixed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 256. Map not updating. Graphics updating was only happening when new GPS data arrived and therefore didn’t update when using static hydrophones. Fixed so that graphics update correctly.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug Sound recorder missing a few samples between files. The sound recorder wav file output system has been rewritten in a much simpler form and now won’t lose samples between consecutive files when new files are started automatically. It will also start new files on integer second or minute boundaries when file durations are set to a maximum fixed value.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 262. Access to SQLite database conversion. This would fail when tables were present which were not created by PAMGuard. &nbsp;Fixes have been put in place for spaces in the table name or for not having an ‘Id’ column. Fixes have not been implemented for spaces in a column name or use of a reserved word as a column name, however if either of these problems do exist it will no longer crash but issue a clear warning and carry onto the next table.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-1.14.00-beta-september-2015" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.14.00 Beta, September 2015</h1>
<p>The format of configuration files has changed for version 1.14.00. Older configurations will load with this new version, but configurations saved with 1.14.00 may not open correctly with earlier versions.</p>
<p>PAMGuard Versions 1.14.00 and above will work with Java 8. PAMGuard will continue to work with Java 7, but support for Java 7 will be removed entirely during 2016. This means that the Microsoft Access Database interface will no longer be available. Version 1.14.00 will continue to support Microsoft Access so long as you don’t upgrade your Java version to Java 8.</p>
<p>An alternative database interface has been provided in the form of SQLite which has been extensively tested with all PAMGuard modules. Limited connectivity to MS Access databases using the open source UCanAccess database connection is provided in Viewer mode which will allow users to convert old Access databases to SQLite or MySQL depending on preference. See the PAMGuard help file for further details.</p>
<p><strong>Other Changes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feature Request 45. Module settings import. Functions have been provided which enable users to import the settings for individual modules into new configurations. See the help file for details.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feature Request 45. Click classification settings export / import. Click classification settings can be exported individually to files and imported into other click detector configurations. See the help file for details.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GPS Loading into PAMGuard Viewer. This has been modified so that the rules governing GPS data collection and storage also apply when loading data from the database. For instance, if you’ve stored all GPS data, you’ve probably got a record every second in the database which can create memory overflows if you try to load a lot of data in the viewer. You can now tell PAMGuard to only load a data point every n seconds which will reduce the number of points loaded. Useful when making large scale overview maps of a survey.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound Trap tools module. This is a development module for users of the <a href="http://www.oceaninstruments.co.nz/">Ocean Instruments</a> Sound Trap who have it configured to run automatic click detection. This feature is currently in its development phase and is of little relevance to most users.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 246. AIS Data Unpacking. Bug in AIS data unpacker fixed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 247. Fixed Landmark display. Landmarks were not displaying in the viewer. This is now fixed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 248. Crash in hydrophone array manager. Bug in array manager would crash PAMGuard when the click detector was configured with more channels than the sound acquisition system (almost impossible to achieve, but someone managed it).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 249. Corrected bugs in Rocca analysis of click events.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 250. DIFAR module was crashing if it attempted to triangulate between more than two simultaneous bearings. Fixed.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 251. Fixed error in DIFAR intensity calculation.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 252. Bug which plotted bearings to whistle and moan detections from the front hydrophone rather than the central position between hydrophones now fixed.</p>

<h1>Version 1.13.05 Beta, July 2015</h1>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved options for plotting clicks on the map in viewer mode - can now select clicks by the type of event they are part of (when marked as part of an offline event).</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>The following bugs have been fixed for this release.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 231. PAMGuard freezing when starting viewer mode. (Caused by an infinite loop in the map module). Fixed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 232. Incorrect click length calculation in ROCCA module. Fixed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 233. ROCCA not analysing correct clicks in Viewer mode. Fixed.</p>

<h1>Version 1.13.04 Beta, June 2015</h1>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spectrogram annotation marks. A simple system for marking spectrograms during real time analysis has been incorporated. To use it, add the module, in the spectrogram settings, select the annotation marks in the ‘Mark Observers’ tab of the spectrogram configuration dialog, and also right click on the spectrogram and select to display the annotations. Annotations are saved to the database so you will also need a database module in your configuration. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new system for important warning messages has been implemented. Warnings such as failure to connect to the GPS or a database error will now appear at the top of the main PAMGuard display.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File and Folder audio input systems now have an optional repeat button which is useful when using PAMGuard for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound File and Folder audio input systems now have an optional time zone setting. Note that PAMGuard analysis should still all be taking place in UTC and that this option is intended to allow the conversion of file times which were not recorded as UTC into UTC and not the other way around. Use the option with caution !</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Open Office Database system has been removed from the list of available options since it is not reliable. If you require a free database solution we recommend you use the MySql Community Server <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/" class="uri">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed Rocca Measurement menu item to open a window containing click events, instead of a submenu listing click events.&nbsp; Using a window simplifies multiple event selections</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DIFAR module has received numerous improvements and bugfixes after 6 weeks of field testing.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>The following bugs have been fixed for this release.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 220 Sample counts were wrapping and causing PAMGuard to report incorrect times after 2^31 samples.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 223. Click detector null clicks (This primarily only affected offline file analysis).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 225. Display of remaining recording time. Was only displaying hours, minutes and seconds. Now correctly displays the number of remaining days.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 226. Spectrogram Mark Observer list doesn’t refresh when modules added or removed.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 227. Logger forms not working with MySQL. Several minor issues with the MySQL interface generally and in particular with the logger forms module have been resolved.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 228. Occasional crashing when training the whistle classifier.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 229. Fixed bug in Viewer Mode which caused Rocca to crash when analyzing click event containing unclassified clicks</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 230. Click Bearing Display. With a two hydrophone system, clicks calculated to have a bearing of exactly 180 degrees would be displayed at 0 degrees on the bearing time display.</p>

<h1>Version 1.13.03 Beta, March 2015</h1>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<p>Small changes have been made to the ROCCA whistle classifier module: Added Sampling Rate, Number of Channels and Geographic Location to the Rocca contour output file.&nbsp; Number of Channels and Geographic Location can be specified by the user in the Rocca Parameters dialog Notes tab.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>A number of minor bugs have been fixed for this release.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug 209. Map zoom level. This was zoomed right into a range of about 1m when new maps were created. This is now fixed and it starts with a default range of 10km on the display.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug 212. Decimator crashed. This only happened very rarely and only if a very large decimation factor was used, so it’s unlikely to have affected anyone.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug 215. Sound acquisition dialog crashing. Could happen if there were no sound cards installed on a system.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug 216. Whistle classifier would not work offline (in viewer mode). This is now fixed.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug 217. PAMGuard viewer fails to read a configuration at startup. This would cause total loss of the PAMGuard configuration in viewer mode and has been rectified.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug 218. SAIL Acquisition card would hang the system. This has also been fixed.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug 219. Problems displaying Offline Click Events in the Viewer map have been fixed.</p>

<section id="version-1.13.00-beta-december-2014" class="level1">
<h1>Version 1.13.00 Beta December 2014</h1>
<p><strong>Configuration Changes</strong></p>
<p><em>Menu Layout</em></p>
<p>The PAMGuard menus have been rearranged into a more intuitive grouping which we believe will help users find functionality more easily.</p>
<p>‘Detection’ menu has been renamed to ‘Settings’ since many menu items within this menu were not directly to do with ‘Detection’.</p>
<p>The groupings within the File / Add Modules menu have been rearranged so that they are now:</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maps and Mapping</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utilities</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensors</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displays</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound Processing</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detectors</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classifiers</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Localisers</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visual Methods</p>
<p>The ‘<em>Hydrophone Array</em>’ menu item moved from ‘File’ to ‘Settings’</p>
<p>‘<em>Multi Threading</em>’ menu item moved from ‘Detection’ (now ‘Settings’) to ‘File’</p>
<p>‘<em>Start</em>’ and ‘<em>Stop</em>’ menu items removed. PAMGuard should be started and stopped using the red and black buttons.</p>
<p><strong>New Modules</strong></p>
<p><em>DIFAR</em> (Localisation Group)</p>
<p>This module, funded by the Australian Antarctic Division allows the de-multiplexing and calculation of angles from military style DIFAR sonobuoys. See online help for details.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>MEAL Localiser</em> (Localisation Group)</p>
<p>This module, developed by Jamie Macaulay of St Andrews University estimates the 3D localisation of clicks using a variety of algorithms. It’s primarily been developed to track harbour porpoise in three dimensions over scales of 10’s of metres. While currently only working with output from the click detector, we hope eventually to extend its use to whistles as well.</p>
<p><em>Accelerometer Readout</em> (Sensors group)</p>
<p>This module, funded by NOAA for the South West Fisheries Science Centre (SWFSC), measures pitch and roll from analogue accelerometer sensors in a hydrophone. Data are fed real time into the updated hydrophone array manager in order that bearings from a tetrahedral tracking array are correctly calculated in real world coordinates.</p>
<p><em>Wild ArcGIS Interface</em> (Maps and Mapping group)</p>
<p>This module, developed by Michael Oswald / SWFSC, allows PAMGuard to output data in a format suitable for display in the WILD ArcGIS marine mammal survey package. See online help for details.</p>
<p><em>Alarms</em> (Utilities Group)</p>
<p>This is a general system of visual and audio alarms developed by Doug Gillespie for use on a variety of projects. The alarms can be coupled to any module or detector in PAMGuard. Where appropriate, modules can control which of their data will cause an alarm action (e.g.&nbsp;in the Click detector you can set which types of classified click will fire the alarm). See online help for details. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Noise Band Monitor</em> (Sound Processing Group)</p>
<p>This module, developed by Douglas Gillespie, Measures octave of third octave noise bands. See online help for details.</p>
<p><em>Filtered Noise Measurement</em> (Sound Processing Group)</p>
<p>This module, developed by Douglas Gillespie, measures noise levels in a single frequency band using a variety of filter functions. See online help for details.</p>
<p><em>Envelope Tracing</em> (Beta Only, Sound Processing Group)</p>
<p>This module, developed by Douglas Gillespie, traces the envelope of a stream of audio data. In particular, it can be used to generate audio output from high frequency data. See online help for details.</p>
<p><em>Long Term Spectral Average</em> (Sound Processing Group)</p>
<p>This module, developed by Douglas Gillespie, calculates the long term spectral average of audio data for a spectrogram display. See online help for details.</p>
<p><em>Echo Detector and Sperm Whale IPI Computation</em> (Beta only, Sound Measurements Group)</p>
<p>These two modules, developed by Brian Miller of the Australian Antarctic Division can be used to estimate the inter pulse interval of sperm whale clicks. (No help available)</p>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<p><em>Hydrophone Configuration</em></p>
<p>The hydrophone configuration system within PAMGuard has been substantially rewritten, partly so that it can support multiple remote buoys (e.g.&nbsp;DIFAR buoys) each of which needs to be localised individually. As a consequence, the layout of the Array Manager dialog will appear somewhat different. Details are available in the online help.</p>
<p><em>FLAC File Support</em></p>
<p>Can now read raw audio data direct from FLAC files. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC">FLAC</a> is a lossless compression algorithm for audio data. Files, or folders of files are accessed in the same way as WAV and AIFF files in the Sound Acquisition module. In a future release we also hope to provide support for writing FLAC files from the sound recorder module.</p>
<p><em>Sound Recorder Module</em></p>
<p>Now supports writing 8 and 24 bit as well as 16 bit files. Also writes data to dated sub folders, starting a new folder each day (UTC). Also provides additional information on disk space on the main display panel. Millisecond time is also now included in the output file names.</p>
<p><em>Datagram Options</em></p>
<p>Datagram options in Viewer have been improved so that the user has to verify the time binning for datagrams the first time the viewer is run and can also change the time bins from the File menu (See the File/BinaryStore/Datagram options menu.</p>
<p><em>Viewer Configuration</em></p>
<p>The Viewer configuration is now saved into a separate database table from ‘normal’ settings so that Viewer can run at same time as normal operation, but with slightly different display settings.</p>
<p><em>Spectrogram Display</em></p>
<p>A system of sliders for setting the frequency and amplitude ranges of the spectrogram display has been implemented. Click the grey button on the top right corner of the spectrogram display ’&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Video Range Module</em></p>
<p>The video range module has been modified so that it can estimate distances based on fixed objects within a picture as well as the horizon.</p>
<p><em>Improved Filter Options</em></p>
<p>Filter options (used as stand-alone filter modules and also within many other modules, such as the click detector and the Filtered Noise Measurement module) have been improved so that the user can specify arbitrarily shaped Finite Impulse Response filters (see online help for details).</p>
<p><em>Radar Display</em></p>
<p>Can now show bearings relative to true North OR the vessel heading. Also has the option of only showing certain types of click and whistle.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reading of wav files. Modifications to the Java wav file reading code in order to read wav files between 2 and 4 GByte in size (the wav standard extends to 4 Gbyte, but Java for some reason only supports up to 2Gbyte)</li>
<li>Ishmael Detector configuration. It was impossible to correctly configure these detectors and configuration settings were not being saved correctly. This has now been rectified.</li>
<li>Logger forms input of character data. Was causing an exception when character input fields were cleared.</li>
<li>Click detector inter click interval display was not working in viewer mode. This has been rectified.</li>
<li>Configuration loading. This has been rationalised since it was often confusing to users. It is now no longer possible to change configurations once PAMGuard has been launched and pressing ‘Cancel’ on the select dialog causes PAMGuard to exit.</li>
<li>Airgun display. If this was included in the PAMGuard model before the GPS module it would hang PAMGuard. This has been rectified.</li>
<li>Fixed occasional exceptions in the sound output modules when playing back from files.</li>
<li>Fixed exceptions in spectrogram user interface.</li>
<li>Fixed National Instruments sound output bug which meant that it could only work with two channel data. Will now work with one to as many channels are supported by the playback device.</li>
<li>Fixed colour bugs in Logger forms which did not display correctly in ‘night’ mode.</li>
<li>Bug fix in simulator. No longer stops or fails to start generating sounds.</li>
<li>Bug in calculated spectrum levels if data were decimated (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/PAMGuard/bugs/187/" class="uri">http://sourceforge.net/p/PAMGuard/bugs/187/</a>) . Did not affect band level calculations.</li>
<li>Bug in noise band monitor. Crashed when sample rate was exactly 2kHz. Fixed</li>
<li>Memory leak in click detector. Severe memory leak when processing clicks in viewer mode now fixed.</li>
<li>Flickering of click display (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/PAMGuard/bugs/191/" class="uri">http://sourceforge.net/p/PAMGuard/bugs/191/</a>) now fixed.</li>
<li>Logger forms crashing in Viewer mode. Bug now fixed.</li>
<li>Storage options (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/PAMGuard/bugs/175/" class="uri">https://sourceforge.net/p/PAMGuard/bugs/175/</a>) whereby clicks were stored to database is now fixed.</li>
<li>Sound Recorder output folder is now defaulting to the User folder (Generally C:\Users\username\PAMRecordings) instead of C:\Program Files (x86)\PamguardBeta which didn’t work since the software doesn’t have write access to that folder.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="version-1.12.00-beta-february-2013">Version 1.12.00 Beta February 2013</h2>
<p><strong>New Modules</strong></p>
<p>Clip Generator: Saves and displays short waveform clips around detections. Can work with any detector (or indeed any other data stream within PAMGuard). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Local time display: displays the computers local time on the main display panel.</p>
<p>WILD interface: provides the user the ability to integrate PAMGuard with the WILD ArcGIS-based marine mammal survey software package.</p>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<p><em>Core Functionality</em></p>
<p>New storage options have been implemented which give the user greater control of where data are stored.</p>
<p>Modules have been arranged into different groups in the configuration menus and tool tip texts have been added to these menus to provide additional information to users. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Radar Display</em></p>
<p>Functionality has been added to the radar display so that bearings can be shown relative to either the vessel or to true North.</p>
<p>Better control of data in viewer mode, making is easy to scroll through and view data for short time periods.</p>
<p><em>GPS</em></p>
<p>Function to import GPS data from other data sources for the PAMGuard viewer.</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>Can now copy data from binary storage to the database offline for any module having both binary and database storage.</p>
<p>Can create a blank MS Access database (2007 and later *.accdb formats only).</p>
<p>Can open MS Access from within PAMGuard to make it easier to view database content.</p>
<p>Support for open office databases.</p>
<p><em>Sound Acquisition</em></p>
<p>National Instruments cards: Added code in support of the new x-series devices.</p>
<p>ASIO sound cards: Added support for a new open source ASIO driver system (jasiohost). The old system has been left in place for now while we assess users response to the newer system.</p>
<p><em>AIS</em></p>
<p>Support has been added to the AIS module to read data from class B AIS stations (used by smaller vessels), Base stations and Aids To Navigation.</p>
<p><em>Spectrogram Display</em></p>
<p>Can now scroll as well as wrap the data.</p>
<p><em>Whistle Detector</em></p>
<p>Stores amplitude and bearing information correctly in the binary files.</p>
<p><em>Logger Forms</em></p>
<p>A substantial amount of work has been carried out on Logger forms, funded by the South West fisheries Science Center.</p>
<p><em>Click Detector</em></p>
<p>Two additional displays have been added to the click detector</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concatenated Spectrogram which enables users to view spectra for multiple clicks within the same event.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inter Detection Interval Display which provides a visual interpretation of the inter-detection interval.</p>
<p>Target Motion Analysis: Updated target motion analysis module so that it works in three (as opposed to two) dimensions.</p>
<p>Alarm in click detector to issue audible warning when certain click types are detected.</p>
<p>Display options have been improved making it easier to display only certain types of clicks.</p>
<p><em>Ishmael Detection Modules</em></p>
<p>We have implemented database storage for output of these modules.</p>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Radar Display: A bug which stopped the radar display from correctly displaying bearings to whistles from arrays containing more than two hydrophone elements has been fixed.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database Speed: A substantial rewriting of some of the indexing methods in the database module has led to a significant increase in the speed at which data are written to the database (orders of magnitude for large databases). This is having a significant impact on the overall reliability of the software. Other changes have increased the speed (again by orders of magnitude) at which data are read back into PAMGuard when using the viewer.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAMGuard start-up options have been substantially improved:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressing cancel will now exit PAMGuard</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearer when a new (blank) configuration is being created</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can create a database for viewer mode from scratch.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timing calculations for simulated data have been improved.</p>

<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<p>‘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding side panels. The panel on the left of the display can be hidden’ this creates more space for other displays.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Detector Displays. Numbers of small displays (e.g.&nbsp;the Wigner plot) is now remembered between runs.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAMGuard Colours: Now selects correct night time colours at programme start-up.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug in Noise Monitor. Version 1.11.01 would crash if only a subset of channels were selected, e.g.&nbsp;if you only measured noise on channel 0 of a two channel configuration. This bug is now fixed</p>

<p><strong>New Modules</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROCCA Whistle Classifier (see online help)</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noise Measurement (see online help)</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logger Forms</p>
<p><strong>Click Detector Updates</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amplitude Selector. This is a small popup window which allows you to set a minimum amplitude for clicks to be displayed on the bearing time display. Primarily useful during offline analysis using the viewer to remove clutter from the display.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICI of unassigned clicks. Previously ICI was only shown for clicks assigned to a click train. Can now be shown for all clicks, but note that this will be meaningless if there is &gt; 1 animal present.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Echo detection. Automatic detection of echoes (see online help).</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offline event marking. Offline event marking similar to functionality in RainbowClick is now available in the PAMGuard viewer. Event summary data is stored in the database and can also be exported to text files (e.g.&nbsp;for importing into the Distance software).&nbsp;</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target motion analysis in two and three dimensions using a variety of models to fit the data (see help files for details).</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toolbar with display species selection.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearings can be calculated using the envelope of the waveform rather than the full waveform. The waveform or envelope can also be filtered prior to bearing calculation.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click species templates. Spectral templates may be generated / reloaded for different types of click.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click concatenated spectrogram display helps to view spectral properties of multiple clicks in an event.</p>
<p><strong>Raw Data Loading</strong></p>
<p>In viewer mode, use the Acquisition control dialog to select the location of wav files associated with the data. This will unlock two useful features of the display:</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spectrogram will automatically generate and display spectrogram data.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spectrogram display and the click detector will both allow you to play back sound via the system sound card.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Features and Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The default preamplifier gain in the acquisition module has been changed to 0dN</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Binary store now saves a complete data map between runs of the PAMGuard viewer. This leads to significant improvements in the time the viewer takes to load large data sets.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataMap: The click and the&nbsp; whistle and moan detectors can now also show graphs of data density as a function of frequency instead of simple bar charts of data density vs.&nbsp;time (datagrams). This makes it much easier to find features such encounters with animals.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formatting of times in scroll bars has been improved (e.g.&nbsp;will say 15 m instead of 900s)</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The FFT Engine can now copy with FFT hops which are greater than the FFT length.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The filter module can now also generate finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. Note however, that FIR filters may require considerably more execution time than IIR filters.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database support for MS Access 2007 and 2010 database formats.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3D bearings from click detector using volumetric arrays. For small arrays (where the distance between elements is less than a few hundred samples) bearings are now correctly calculated in three dimensions.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main GUI frame no longer disappears behind other windows when viewer data are loaded.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toolbar with quick access to start / stop buttons.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filter and Decimator modules output data name. These were not unique in previous versions which made it impossible for downstream modules to connect to the correct data stream. This has been fixed.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whistle classifier has some new features in the classifier training panel. It is also now possible to export training data files directly from binary data files.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hydrophone localisation systems have been updated to better use information from true and magnetic heading sensors.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The FFT module has been updated to ensure it finds it’s correct data source, even if that data source is loaded after the FFT module is created.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="version-1.10.00-beta-december-2010">Version 1.10.00 Beta December 2010</h2>
<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<p>1. Binary storage module.</p>
<p>Performs a parallel role to the PAMGAURD database but uses binary files in a proprietary format which is considerably more efficient for data of unknown length such as whistle contours or small clips of click waveform. This feature is currently implemented in the following modules:</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Detector</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whistle and Moan detector</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AIS</p>
<p>2. Improved offline viewer functionality.</p>
<p>The offline viewer is much improved with better data scrolling and the ability to view data either stored in the database or the binary storage system. Work has stated on functions which read and use data stored in audio files. This is currently limited to re-calculating and displaying displaying spectrogram data during viewer mode operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Heading sensor readout</p>
<p>PAMGuard can now read true or magnetic heading data from gyro compasses, fluxgate compasses, etc. See help for details.</p>
<p>4. Click detector offline event marking</p>
<p>Functionality for offline analysis, similar to that in RainbowClick is now partially incorporated into the PAMGuard click detector in viewer mode. Help files have not yet been developed for these features.</p>
<p>5. Better support in the Decimator module for non-integer frequency division (i.e.&nbsp;previous versions would convert well from 96kHz to 48kHz, but not from 500kHz to 48kHz)</p>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>1. Placement of axes on some displays (array manager and depth side panel). Problem in 1.9.01 Beta now fixed.</p>
<p>2. Fixed problems of NMEA read out not restarting after a serial drop out. NMEA now restarts correctly.</p>
<p>3. Fixed a memory leak which caused occasional crashes, particularly when large numbers of files were processed offline.</p>
<p>4. The correct file path separator is used in Sound recording names under Linux (which uses “/” as opposed to “\” on Windows).</p>

<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>Acquisition dialog for ASIO sound cards was resetting all channel numbers to zero.</p>
<p>Degree symbols throughout PAMGuard have been fixed so that they work on all Win64, (Mac and Linux.)</p>
<p>An unnecessary channel warning from the seismic veto has been removed.</p>
<p>Contour check boxes on the map dialog have now been placed in a scrolling pane so that if there are lots of contours, the dialog doesn’t become too bit to fit on a screen.</p>
<p><strong>New Feature</strong></p>
<p>psf file name is now displayed in the title bar of the main PAMGuard display.</p>
<p>Windows Installer now sets permissions on PAMGuard folder so that don’t need to be an administrator in order to create new files in that directory. Prevents problems especially under Vista/Windows 7 when saving psfs and recording sounds to the default directory.&nbsp;</p>

<section id="version-1.9.00-beta-april-2010" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="version-1.9.00-beta-april-2010">Version 1.9.00 Beta April 2010</h2>
<p><strong>Channel numbering</strong></p>
<p>A new internal channel numbering scheme for ASIO sound cards was released on 8 March in Alpha version 1.8.02. These changes have now been promoted to this Beta release 1.9.00. These changes were described in an email to PAMGuard User, the text of which is repeated here:</p>
<p>Within PAMGuard, there have been constant problems with lookup tables relating hardware channel numbers to internal channel numbers. 99.9% of the time, this is not a problem since people are just reading channels 0 and 1 from a normal sound card or a list of channels 0,1,2,3, etc from an ASIO card or National Instruments card. However, when using the ASIO sound acquisition system, it is possible to read out hardware channels 2,3,4,5 say and those numbers would propagate through PAMGuard and be used by all the detectors. While this gave some clarity to&nbsp; the displays, it also created a number of problems since look up tables were constantly required to relate hardware numbers and software numbers in every PAMGuard module. Since this type of channel numbering was only implemented several years into the PAMGuard project, it was never fully implemented or well supported by the different modules which resulted in a number of bugs which could cause confusion as to which hydrophones were being used during localisation or during calibrated measurement. The situation tended to only arise with a small number of ASIO sound cards such as the RME Fireface 400 on which the most useful inputs, the balanced line inputs, are hardware channels 4,5,6 and 7 on the back of the instrument. (On the Fireface 800, the balanced line inputs are channels 0 to 7). When using the National Instruments system, data were always sent into the rest of PAMGuard with sequential channel numbering starting at 0. This was required in order to support multiple NI Daq boards where it is possible to read for example channel 0 and 1 on two different devices, so to uniquely identify channels in the rest of PAMGuard, the only rational thing to do was to re-label those channels 0,1,2,3.</p>
<p>There have been other annoyances with the ASIO channel numbering scheme. For instance, if you had a configuration which worked in real time using channels 7 and 8 of a sound card, you could not use that same configuration to analyse wav files, which would always read their data as channels 0 and 1. Similarly if you switched sound cards, you may have to reconfigure every detector and several of the displays to handle the changes in channel numbering.</p>
<p>I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to work out a better system for handling channel numbering in PAMGuard and have decided that the only practical thing to do is to force all software channel numbering back to a zero indexed system. i.e.&nbsp;even if you read out hardware channels 3,4,5 and 6, within PAMGuard, everywhere apart from the Sound acquisition dialog, you will see them listed as channels 0,1,2 and 3. &nbsp;The consequences of doing this are mainly very good. Most users will not notice any changes. For those who need for some reason to read channel numbers not starting at zero things will be more stable. However, when you go to a new version with this new feature, it will be necessary to reconfigure all the modules in any existing configurations. To do this, open the configuration dialog for each module in turn and select the correct, zero indexed, channel number.</p>
<p><strong>Other Changes / new features</strong></p>
<p>PAMGuard Viewer</p>
<p>The way in which data are loaded for each module has changed in the PAMGuard viewer. In the scroll bar for each display, at the right hand end, there are buttons for pagingforward, backward and setting page length options.</p>
<p>Click Detector Bearing Time display</p>
<p>Older versions used a vertical scroller in the right hand side of the main bearing time display to control the display length. This has been removed and replaced by a small control consisting of an edit box and a spinner (up and down arrows) at the right hand end of the horizontal scroll bar. The scroll system now also enabled you to scroll back through up to one minute of data during real time operation.</p>
<p>Whistle and Moan Detector</p>
<p>Bearings are now written to the database.</p>
<p>PAMGuard Viewer scrolling mechanism has changed.</p>
<p>Each display now has a small control in the right hand end of a scroll bar or a slider which allows you to page through data. This is only well implemented for the map, but will be an increasingly important feature as more displays are set up for offline data viewing in future releases.</p>
<p>Viewer data map</p>
<p>When using the PAMGuard viewer an additional panel will be displayed showing an overview of data quantity (per hour) from the various database tables connected to PAMGuard.</p>
<p>Spectrogram Display overlays</p>
<p>The mechanism behind this has changed. Should not affect operations, but if you have problems with overlays on the spectrogram, please notify <a href="mailto:support@PAMGuard.org">support@PAMGuard.org</a></p>
<p>All display overlays</p>
<p>Now pick up line colours from the Display symbol manager, so it’s possible to set line colours by selecting a symbol with a particular line colour from the Display menu.</p>
<p>Database</p>
<p>Default name for the Database module has changed from “ODBC Database” to just “Database”. This will not affect existing configurations.</p>
<p>Sound acquisition</p>
<p>Changes made for a previous Mac build now incorporated into main Beta branch. This should allow for basic 2 channel sound acquisition using Macs.</p>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<p>Whistle and Moan Detector</p>
<p>Was not detecting sounds when noise reduction was performed in the Whistle Moan Detector, but was OK when noise reduction ran in the FFT module. This problem has been resolved.</p>
<p>Whistle Classifier</p>
<p>Bug fix in database output. The first species probability column was setting to zero. This is now fixed</p>
<p>Ishmael Detectors</p>
<p>Better rendering of detection boxes on spectrogram display and more meaningful names in spectrogram display menu.</p>
<p>Sound acquisition</p>
<p>When not using NI or AISO cards PAMAGUARD acquires sound using javax.sound which only supports two channels. Max number of channels now specified as 2 rather than undefined.</p>
<p>Serial Comms</p>
<p>A few changes so more through tidying up of resources when a port is closed. Might prevent a few problems when using a GPS.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="version-1.8.01-beta-february-2010">Version 1.8.01 Beta February 2010</h2>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>Crashes caused in real time or Mixed Mode if the number of software channels exceeds the number of hydrophones configured in the array manager. It is of course illogical to have software channels which are not assigned to a hydrophone, so rather than entirely prevent PAMGuard from crashing I have inserted additional checks into the hydrophone array dialog which will prevent the user from closing that dialog unless all software channels are assigned to a hydrophone.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="version-1.8.01-beta-february-2010-1">Version 1.8.01 Beta February 2010</h2>
<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Play back of high frequency wav files through National Instruments (NI) cards: When analysing wav files, sound can be output at high frequency (depending on the specification of the NI card). The primary motivation for this has been to develop a test bed for high frequency sound acquisition whereby we can play 500kHz recordings of harbour porpoise out of an NI card on one machine, into NI cards on a different machine which are testing high frequency versions of the click detector.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that this does not (yet) permit simultaneous acquisition and playback through</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NI data acquisition cards.</p>
<p><strong>Minor features and bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synchronisation of FFT functions. Prevents threads accessing the same FFT module simultaneously which was occasionally causing crashes of the click detector if multiple hydrophone groups were being used.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pop up menus on click detector displays: some of these were not displaying correctly when running under Linux. This has been fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patch panel can now output channels which are not in it’s input list.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Null pointer trapped in Ishmael spectrogram correlation module.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False buffer overflows at low sample rates stopped (size of data in individual data blocks had been increased at low sample rates, but when this exceeded 3s a false buffer overflow would occur).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="version-1.8.00-beta-january-2010">Version 1.8.00 Beta January 2010</h2>
<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major changes to the multi-threading model in PAMGuard.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This results in a major speed up of data exchange between modules and can lead to a x4 improvement in overall performance.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional speed improvements have been made to the click detector which results in an approximate 30% speed improvement for that one module.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound playback when monitoring using a sound card (previously only possible with ASIO sound cards) but see warning in help file about sound card synchronisation.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wigner time-frequency plot for the click detector. Clicks are NOT automatically displayed in the Winger window as they are for the waveform and spectrum windows since the Wigner transformation is very time consuming. Clicks will be displayed if you select them with the mouse.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New click classifier methods, which include extraction of frequency sweep parameters. (Please note that this click is not yet documented. The old classifier is still available).</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearing ambiguity resolution for planar and volumetric arrays. New features in array dialog for estimations of errors on array location. These feed into to a maximum likelihood estimate of angles from small 2D or 3D sub arrays to give two polar angle coordinates. this can be used to resolve left right ambiguity and is implemented for both the click and the whistle/moan detectors. As a result, the click detector bearing time display can now be set to go from -180 to 180 degrees rather than 0 - 180 degrees. In this case, clicks in the upper half of the bearing display will be to port and clicks in the right half will be to starboard. As you pass a whale which is to port, the clicks will move UP the display. In the long term, I hope to turn this display around so that time is up the screen rather than across.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Small features and bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checks on Recordings and Clicks output folders before PAMGuard starts.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colours in spectrogram amplitude display correctly match the user selection.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Default parameters in the radar display are for quiet clicks to be shown further away.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ishmael spectrogram correlation module checks for kernel creation and no longer crashes if the kernel is not present.</p>

<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong> since release 1.5.01</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Channel lists in output data streams of Decimator and other modules fixed, so that when channel numbers change, downstream modules configurations get the correct list of available channels.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GPS data from the GPGGA string are now correctly unpacked (formerly, there was a bug in how times were unpacked between 1200 and 2400 GMT).</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed NMEA dialog problems when no COM ports detected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Modules / Features</strong> (see help file for details)</p>

<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simulated sound sources. New sound source simulator. Accessible from within the main data acquisition dialog. The old simulator didn’t work well and has been deleted.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copying and Printing</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New menu functionality by right clicking on any of the tabs of the main tab control will allow the user to copy the tab contents to the system clipboard from where it can be copied into other programs (e.g.&nbsp;Word, Powerpoint, etc.).Some modules, such as the map, have this implemented in other menus (right click) and also allow printing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installer now checks for previous versions of PAMGuard and uninstalls them before proceeding with installation.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>The help file pages for the acquisition module have undergone major revision Minor additions and edits have been made to many other help pages</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bug fix</strong> in whistle detector bearing calculation.</p>
<p>1.3.00 Beta. January 2009</p>
<p><strong>New modules</strong></p>
<p>New Likelihood detector.</p>
<p>The likelihood detector module is an implementation of a likelihood ratio test with flexible algorithms and configuration to estimate likelihood. It is</p>
<p>suitable for detecting both short duration Odontocete clicks (Sperm, Beaked, etc.) as well as moderate duration Mysticete calls (Humpback, Bowhead, etc.).It is not suitable for detecting whistles.</p>
<p>Note that the likelihood detector will not run with PAMGuard in multithreading mode.</p>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>Click Detector - click train detector. Further synchronisation to deal with multithreading.</p>
<p>Depth Readout - Bug fix to prevent crash when dialog is opened when no input device is installed.</p>
<p>Localiser ’ Further synchronisation of detection group localiser (affects stability of click train localiser and whistle localiser in</p>
<p>multithread operation).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beta-december-2008">1.2.0 Beta December 2008</h2>
<p>This release contains many bug fixes from the PAMGuard industry field trial which took place in the Gulf of Mexico on the RV New Venture in November 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Map. Full drawing of map base (contours &amp; grid lines) when window is resized.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Detector. Display and detection continue after click detection parameter changes</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASIO Sound acquisition. Was not returning channels in correct order. &nbsp;Now fixed.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Instruments sound acquisition. An NI interface has now been written &nbsp;for Windows.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NMEA, AIS and GPS modules. No longer crash in response to incomplete&nbsp; NMEA strings</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spectrum display (plug in module for spectrogram). Now correctly saves &nbsp;settings between runs.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialogs (all modules). Have improved scaling and packing of dialogs when channels or textual content change.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model viewer. Have stopped it from jumping on top of the main PAMGuard &nbsp;display when dialogs are closed.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General problems with timing solved (sound cards not always running at the speed they should run at). Large improvements in overall PAMGuard reliability.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Airgun display is now correctly updating using either GPS or AIS data.</p>
<p><strong>Outstanding bugs</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Instruments sound acquisition. Hangs occasionally. Requires restart &nbsp;of PAMGuard to get going again.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Detector. Click train detector uses a lot of memory and can cause out of memory errors.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ishmael spectrogram plug in graphics occasionally disappear when detection parameters are adjusted.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vertical scale on the raw data plug in display is incorrect.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound recorder. 1/10 of a second of data are occasionally lost when the &nbsp;recorder stops and restarts with a new file.</p>
<p><strong>New Features in existing modules</strong></p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Window state remembered on shut down and window restored to same size &nbsp;on start-up</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show modules with no processes in viewer. This allows them to be renamed</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better drawing of held spectrogram when putting mark rectangles on a spectrogram display. All panels are now correctly frozen. The rectangle is drawn in red on the marked panel and in green on other panels.</p>
<p>‘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spectrogram. Frequency information displayed in a ’hover’ box when the mouse is moved over the display. Choice of colour maps for display.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound playback. Now supported in ASIO sound cards, so you can have sound coming in through the ASIO card and back out through its headphone socket (after passing through PAMGuard filters and other modules) at the same time.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operation will depend on the configuration of individual sound cards and how they are configured to mix incoming data with data from the PC. This is sometimes a physical switch on the card and sometimes a software configuration utility specific to that sound card.</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NMEA/GPS Simulator has options that set the start location, the speed, course, random course changes and whether or not AIS data are output</p>
<p>’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AIS Data are a fixed data set recorded in the English Channel).</p>
<p><strong>Multithreading</strong></p>
<p>PAMGuard now processes data in each module in a different processing thread. This allows PAMGuard to use both processor cores on dual or multi core processor machines. However, multithreading may still cause instability in some modules. An option is therefore accessible from the main Detection menu to enable and disable multithreading.</p>
<p><strong>New Modules</strong></p>
<p>The following new modules have been added to the Beta Release 1.2.0</p>
<p>Sound Processing</p>
<p>1. Seismic Veto. A module for detecting and then cutting out very loud sounds.</p>
<p>Utilities</p>
<p>2. Depth Readout. Readout for analogue depth sensors using MeasurementComputing data acquisition devices.</p>
<p>Visual Methods</p>
<p>3. Video Range measurement. Will not capture video, but can open jpeg, bitmap files, etc. or you can paste in an image for video range analysis.</p>
<p>4. Angle Measurement. Shaft angle encoding using Autonnic Research Ltd A3030 Absolute Rotary Encoder (good for measuring the angle of binocular stands).</p>
<p>5. Fixed Landmarks. Enter and display fixed points for overlay on the map.&nbsp;</p>
